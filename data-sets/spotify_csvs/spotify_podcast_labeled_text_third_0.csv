I think one of my greatest strengths is an ultra Runner is that I am totally oblivious as to what I'm capable of and I think that's a good trait to have you if you go into a race questioning if you can do it or not that's really hard mentally to kind of grapple with that over the course of the day and if you go,ant

It's really a pretty cool team to be a part of that's awesome and they'll be a bunch of them racing this year. Yep. Yeah, they'll be quite a few of us. I think we got maybe six or seven athletes here cool will will a few more than be pacing. What is what's what's your crew like this year for Western States? Yeah, so I'm sure they'll be a big Nike contingent out.",bee
2462," Great. He's I meant David out at at at the Woodside ramble 50k in California this past winter and yeah, we just had an awesome connection. He's a great guy and a lot of good stuff to come from him. He's gonna he's gonna be good. Athlete. Yeah for sure. He's he is a funny guy. What are some of the things that you you've learned after getting into the trail running side of things that perhaps might have had some carryover.",ant
2463," Really helped me just not care too much about what other people are doing. I get excited when like last year. I saw Jim Walmsley break the record at Western States and I was like, that'd be something really cool to do in a few years, you know go after that record or something and in and I think about things like that, but I don't get caught up in what Walmsley is doing every day or every week and on Shabbat. I don't even I'll randomly see something he does and give them some Kudos and that's pretty that's pretty much the extent of it, but I think I'm doing it.",bee
2464," And it's great. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if it's a real thing but I like to think of it as cellular reconstruction. It's a day where everything just repairs right and gets better and whether it's actually happening or not thinking that yeah, I need positive thought. Yeah, so you ate the night before I mean, it makes a big difference. You may feel a little sluggish the next day on her you run out but you're working for us that Wednesday. Yeah, you know, I think it's a really important day and if anything mentally and to spend some time with your",ant

Yeah. It's been it's been pretty cool to see how do you feel about balance balance has something that people seem to be on either one side of the fence or the other and no pun intended?",ant
2466, Way is Devon Yanko has talked about this too. I do I think a lot of it for me is running kind of gives me a sense of purpose. I suppose it's when I'm out there doing it. I feel like I'm doing it for some reason. I can't explain it. But something I was it was a it was sort of a calling at whether it's to inspire or or if it was for myself. I don't know but when I'm out running I feel this purpose and and reason to be doing it and it kind of,bee
2467,Welcome to for the long run the podcast exploring the why behind what keeps Runners running long strong and motivated. I'm your host Jonathan Levitt. I've been running for a few years now and have the privilege of meeting many incredible Runners on my travels all across the country. This podcast is intended to share those amazing conversations.,ant

And so I was very lucky that the man with Chuck Club took me on because when I joined the current situation was that they had housing for you. They had gym for you like gym membership and massage stipends and I thought about it. I was like man, what else do I need? Right because everybody else they",bee

I just I just kind of go through my warm up an hour before and I keep everything really relaxed. Everyone has like all these crazy drills and things they have to do and usually when I finish my warm up, I'm like I could probably roll right into this. Yeah, but you know, just to keep my mind kind of",bee

2472," You don't have to have I feel like you don't have to have as much speed as you might in the five. Like I feel like that's kind of where my weakness lies in the 5K. I don't have that much natural turnover turnover to be able to run the last lap and like a 50 or something and but you run a quick 5K. Yeah, but I think that's more off of like strength training. Yeah then so I feel like you know",ant
2473," With running years. So when I start running when I'm 16, and I'm only doing it for two months in the fall two months in the spring. I don't consider myself a runner then right and then you think of like even my first three years of college I wasn't able to string together really that many months. So if you look at a kid who's 21, but they started running, you know, 50 miles of Eco 16. They're probably the same it. Well. Yeah the same age as me as far as",bee

He's like, you know, you might not even make the team this year and and he's like, you know, if anything I think it'd be great. If you could be good your second year here because I only had two years and so he's like, why don't you why would just kind of take a steady approach? I'm like, what are we gonna do with all that time in between he's like just going to trains run? Yeah, that's gonna run. It's gonna be okay. Yeah. Yeah, it's wild.",ant
2475," Are not quick to force two people to be together if they're training doesn't line up like, you know a guy who I do a lot of runs with is a marathoner. And so we really don't do a lot of workouts together, but we can always always get an easy run in together if it works out. So here's another one. What's what's your easy pace?",bee
2476," It's still crazy to me that someone pays me to run. It's super silly. Yeah, and I try to do as much as I can for them and always promote them. So if you're listening go buy some Skechers, but yeah, I know I think that's truly living the dream is when someone pays you to do something that you already love doing. So, how does that relationship work? How do you how do you prove or maybe not maybe prove is the wrong word, but how do you ensure that that that relationship?",bee
2477," Well, I tried to run the steeple and it didn't go. Well, I didn't really get a chance to practice because the winter was bad. Yeah, I opened up in Mount Sac and I ran like nine flat which it's just not good. Yeah, and so it was kind of desperation. I was on sponsored. It's like I'm probably going to go be an engineer if I don't make USA's easier because like, you know, I think that's like the bare minimum you should be able to do as a professional if you want to call this your profession and so we're like well you can go run the five and",ant

2479," No, like I wasn't a runner growing up but started my kind of my story is like a lot of people story. I was just just a average athlete and I played that well, I guess I was a division one athlete. I played lacrosse at Michigan State University. I kind of stopped, you know, as most of us. Do you not going pro and write in college athletics? And so I wanted to pick up something to stay.",ant
2480," Definitely. So where does your mind go when you're doing these like super long super hard efforts? I mean, I'm thinking of your your 10 or 11 Days running across or running up Israel. Yeah day five day a things are starting to not feel great. Like what? What are you thinking in those moments? Oh man, I was super lucky like that was one of the things like we were talking about earlier like it's been a big year like if your listeners don't",ant
2481," And I think a lot of times when we're running, you know, we start out with it like I want to do this, but then it becomes like your family becomes involved and your friends become involved. And if you get to a certain level you have start to have like other, you know, relationships like sponsors and whatnot. And so and then it then it becomes a lot I think more impactful. And so that's what I love about running is like you can bring all these people that may not ever have a desire to run.",ant
2482," and your life and and so like I'll do like stretches while I brush my teeth and like while I'm watching TV, I'll like roll or use like the hyper Vice or something and so like just figuring out like, how can I be more efficient? I think it's something that works really well for me and then trying to be consistent I think like consistency is much more important than you know, having like the killer work it right once I totally think I'd rather have five workouts that are just",ant

That's also like I know what that looks like and that's that's going to be hard and I also I'm like maybe I can just run a marathon a day all next week and so like that that looks interesting to and then kind of work this beadwork into that weight a marathon a day for a week. Yeah, just like you've done in the past. Yeah, exactly. Like I just know that's a good way to get some Fitness and so like in it and",bee
2484," In the way that I want like, you know, if I was like trapped in my body and I couldn't I couldn't move I think that would be really scary. I think not having my family would be super scary. Like I try to bring them as much as I can to these events. Like I think one of the things were like most proud of is our kids have been to like 20 countries and they're like 12 and 10 and so like having them part of this journey and is important but like I'm scared like",bee
2485, use that gift as much as I can definitely. So the goal of this podcast is to explore the why behind what keeps Runners running long strong and motivated and I feel like you're the epitome of like running long strong and motivated. So like what's what's your why? Why do you why do you do it? I think at first and I think it's still like one of my guiding principles is like just to see if I can like,ant
2486," As in Partners along for the ride, what's it like sort of navigating those Waters or obligations and also not overextending yourself or you know, you have to rest like you can't you can't be walking around, you know all over Boston or all over New York or Chicago or Tahoe or whatever and expect that, you know, you can just like that like be perfect. So, how do you how do you balance like what people are",bee
2487," A meditative and thoughtful about like what I'm doing and why and where I'm placing my feet and that just kind of transitions into like this Flow State almost and I do a lot of visualization like how it's going to feel like what I'm going to do when this happens or that happens, but I don't have a practice or anything like that. Got it who are some of your role models in the sport over the last handful of years man. That's a great.",ant
2488," He's one of my role models. Like he's like, he's a mutt like 30 marathons this year. Yeah, you like runs mall, like super hard and like he just is just a baller and like I love the way that guy just kind of rolls and he just doesn't like he he's bucked like and for for like someone like me to do it, like that's one thing but like our culture is a little bit more accommodating of that but like to do that in the Japanese culture is maybe a little bit harder, especially",ant

So this year it blew my mind. Like I just could not believe how many people were there was awesome. So it's chatting with a friend and she's an accomplished ultrarunners. She's run a whole bunch of races short medium long distance. So she's run the gamut of you know, super cool places and she said there's nothing like this. There's nothing that even comes close to comparing you and you just have to",ant
2491," I feel really good about that. And so I think being super consistent but not letting it consume. You was something that was helpful for me. So you the not letting it consume you as an interesting point. So your full-time job is outside of running and outside of social media. Well, not really you're you're in social media for full-time, right? Well funny. I actually just left my corporate job a week ago. All right, there we go. So change so what are you doing now?",bee
2492," Switching gears completely. Yeah, I think just because my mom did like all my friends played Sports growing up. I went to a super competitive high school or everyone was really good at everything and I was not good at anything requiring coordination and I don't gosh, I don't even know I just I guess it was I just started maybe I think it's a Ferris Bueller. Like I just I just started right just started running. So, why are you",ant
2493," Thousand but it's a hundred waves. So I was in Wave 2 and I thought I was jaded because of how perfect it was being so far up and I was chatting with a friend and a coffee shop the next day and I was like, yeah, I don't know. I was just, you know wave to but everything was perfect. That's awesome. And a lady was like was listening to us. She's like, hey, I don't mean to, you know bought in but like I wasn't like wave 87 and my experience was the saying. Okay, that makes me so excited. Yeah, so it's just like you you do the you do the 10K and",bee
2494," More of a website as opposed to a Blog I think people think of logs is like a personal journal and I don't think it's that as much and Instagram and Twitter have definitely changed the blogging platform where people can have like Instagram can be a Blog and a way where they shared every night. I used to like really desire to have a Blog and then for whatever reason I didn't but I did and I just couldn't stay consistent with it, but I found myself.",bee
2495," You know, sometimes it feels really bad and sometimes you're like this is the best I'm much better about rest days. I'm much better about recovery days, which I think those are different for me. Like my recovery runs. I am like I will not run with people on my recovery days just so I can really really listen to my body and if I need to go out at 9:15, like that's what we're doing. I've loved the the shift of away from people posting about their hard run.",bee
2496," Last year and massage somewhat, but I definitely was more consistent this year with PT massage. And then I started going to a chiropractor. I'd like some back issues that run in the family. I was just more consistent with them but everything felt pretty good. Mostly because as soon as I felt something I dealt with it rather than ignoring it and then it's like oh crap, like now this is a real problem. I love the line. Listen to The Whispers before they become screen. Yeah.",ant
2497," Tuesday, so I had had a rest day and his his feedback was let's really focus on making time for sleep. Even if it means shorter runs. So here's a running coach who's saying you can run less and sleep more. Yeah and to do that you'll get better results. Yeah, I could show me the same thing. Yeah, and and and it's like yes, that makes sense, but it's been a consistent Trend over the last year that like sleeping.",ant
2498, balance is a myth and it's like if think about like the best moment you've had in your life and you were probably super unbalanced to get to that point and I think that that's really really important perspective because if you have big goals and you have big dreams like you want to start your own business you want to qualify for Boston you're going to be unbalanced but I think it's being aware of this is your priority right now and being willing to sacrifice some other things are they're not going to be your priority and being okay with that and like acknowledging it I think.,bee
2499," How do you balance having a presence with being present? It's hard. Sometimes I want to throw my phone out the window. Honestly, I have a friend and I'm like look, I just want to go on vacation to throw my phone in the ocean. I schedule as much as I can for certain things. I have timers on my phone to like start to come see me off. Yeah, I there's some things where I'm like",ant
2500," Five years old. I was that girl either kicking a soccer ball or had a ball in her hand. But my most favorite thing was to race the boys in the neighborhood. So I am a lifelong athlete and I just couldn't leave sports. Like I was going to Texas A&M to study psychology and you know is going to just do just general counseling work and all that kind of stuff but I also worked as a personal trainer and loved it. It was great. However, everything that was",ant
2501," Cast so far but the consistent Trend and again the goal is exploring get Ian and what we gotta love it, you know. Yeah what keeps people interested in. Yeah, and so so I had this I had this conversation with with been Rosario and Ali kefir and they both highlighted this in particular that they're so invested in and been really hammered the point home with his athletes. He's like look, you know, we don't care about results at the end of the day we care that our athletes",ant
2502, Right and it catches us off guard because I think sometimes maybe it's not even conscious and I'm guilty. I've been guilty of this many times myself. We're we're just like it's not supposed to feel this way. This is how it's supposed to go. Right then. It's like our brain literally capsizes in our head and we go from being positive and optimistic to when we're challenged. We don't know how to meet the challenge. Hmm. So I want to know what,ant
2503," Talk about the athlete, right? Okay. How do you how do you sort of pull that and and bring that into not the coach athlete relationship with the athlete relationship? Mmm, like the athletes relationship with themselves? Yeah. Yeah. So, you know kind of depends on your personality, I think number one, but what you want to do is",bee
2504," Like that and it's really hard, you know, I think for a lot of people to hang around Runners when they're injured. Yeah, I'll never forget. I was having a conversation with a girl a while back and she's like Adrienne. Is it normal to want to punch somebody when you see that running and can't and I'm just like why? Yes. Yes, it is. Don't do that. But yeah, it was just like because we do we have those feelings.",bee
2505," Risk, re-injury be risk of just getting into a mental whole we don't necessarily need to get into because there's a lot of Runners. We really heavily identify with our sport. So make sense. You think do you think the highs and lows are are you know critical do you think that that the the lows make the highs better? Oh, absolutely. Yeah because I think you know just like with anything else.",ant
2506," I've just I've gone away from like the 98 percent being 98% great and and dropped to 80 80 percent good rat if you look way better basically unsustainable, right? Yeah. It's and it's amazing and and I mean anecdotally I've actually lost weight loss. I've lost a pound or two eating what I want eating more than I was eating prior. I had a conversation with one of our sport.",bee
2507," Fucking hurts. Yeah, make it hurt more. Yeah the nail right on the head right? There is its chains like just like with your son my relationship with food your relationship with pain. Yep. If you look at it as it's just a necessary thing, then it becomes a challenge if now it becomes a threat and I can't feel like this. I can't handle it. I mean our primitive brains just like all it up. Yeah, but if we're smart we can use our cerebral cortex and actually process.",ant
2508," Just love that. Yeah, I love that feeling. So so, where do you where do you live? That's good, because your programming your mind.",ant
2509," so far, but those who maybe they don't have quite the genetic gifts. However, they're you know, they believe that they can do the training. They believe that they can improve that tends to take these these people pretty far and belief and yeah. Yeah exactly because I mean we think of, you know, we had we always have those stories of the athlete who maybe wasn't as talented but made it through the ranks and is now like a Collegiate or a pro Runner or something.",ant
2510," So viewing the challenge as viewing the races a challenge and not a threat is is how to turn the nerves and for that you got to tell your lizard brain to shut up. You know, it's remenham brain is just like it wants something like it wants to be comfortable but you signed up to Iraq for a raise here for a reason comfortable. So so I had a really good chat with with step Violet ahead of Western States this past year. I think was the Thursday before the race.",ant
2511," The section that I'm on yeah, I also love the way they wrote the thing because it's like that's working with me like that kind of sad. I mean, that's kind of how I sound. Yeah real informal real light-hearted and all that kind of stuff. But what I like about also like about it is about sustainable running and this but you can be successful and you can be happy.

It starts to get into the things like God because just hop in a marathon and then you crush the marathon and Crush all the other thing. That's awesome. The worry is what we see in a lot of athletes is the the positive feedback loop going the other direction.

I think I have a favorite character and the only reason is because she actually owned up to what she had to do.",bee

If I am I meant to just be here to like, you know, so I feel like it would be kind of relatable to be able to watch that on camera to be like, oh like no wait. Okay, so it's normal to feel these things and guess what my prince charming could happen. Now it can happen when I'm 30 could happen when I'm 35, like it doesn't have to happen right now. Yeah, and I feel like that is something that the Bold type would probably be the one to take on. Yeah, I think would be really nice to see them kind of tear down that line.",ant
3225," The.com so that last scene has me crazy to know it's going to happen that yeah. Well actually I was very surprised by tonight's episode because of the way that it ended, you know, it ended with a lot of loose strings and at the I don't know if at the time that they were filming they knew that they were getting a like fourth season, but if they wouldn't have like if we were waiting right now to know if they were getting a fourth season, I would be so impatient. I would be like, okay, when did when did the news come out? Like I need to know because I need answers because",bee

It might be a constant reminder for her that you know right now cat doesn't want to give her another shot. And so I really wonder if there's going to be some new tension growing there. Yeah, probably it's kind of like, I know I always think that relationships in the workplace. You have to be careful with because if you're going to be together",bee

Exactly and then with Sian, you know, she was probably telling herself for a while. Now, you know, I really want to be a designer. I really want to be a designer and so she felt she really had to be a designer and you know kind of give up the fun of her work at Scarlet to be able to do stuff like designed this dress. Yeah, so I'm very happy that she got the chance to actually work through that and",ant

I think that's that's what I was waiting for her to do because last episode when she was like, oh, well, I you think about taking it. She wasn't very supportive of the fact that he was maybe wanting to sue like pursue this and this was the thing that we beat like we talked about but I think that it was great that she bought it. I I don't like the fact that she bought him the ticket but I think that it will be interesting to see kind of how the Bull type tackles long-distance relationship.",bee
3229," This is not the right time not the place. There's a time and place for everything and that wasn't the place or the time because I agree with you. I wonder if you know going back and watching the episode if what Jane's response would have been if he had asked something. Like I know someone who made a mistake with his girlfriend, as you know, as a journalist or whatever, what would you explain or like? How would you handle the situation? Like what would you think would you?",bee

I'm sorry. I mean I was just I'm so happy about that because honestly, I was irritated with this weird like kind of at each other's throats or not even that but this weird tension between him and Jaclyn and I'm like, I don't want to be better and it's like come on boys.",bee

Then you just turn it off.",leech
3232," Isn't it will face some issues next season. I think perhaps maybe they'll be greatly downsizing the magazine and kind of uplifting or like bringing more on to the.com which kind of sucks because we all you know, love Jacqueline and she was going into that meeting with the board. So that's still lingering on kind of what decision they made and jack is not the end of the episode. No one knows where she is.

So he even had really hard choose to kind of fill in that beginning part, but it was also just the way that he came towards the police.",ant
3235," You're saying I'll it's hard to kind of figure out what their plan could have been because from the looks of it. Obviously, they weren't going to break in and try and publish it behind the board's back especially because once it was published they were so paranoid about, you know, losing their jobs. So I think this idea I guess was just to really make Jaclyn feel like she did the right thing and you know, like what she did was worth it. Hmm.",bee
3236," As well, but I also am just kind of going back to the magazine thing. Like why can't they have both why can't she had up digital and they still have a primary and you know, like I mean, I think that's just supposed to be a nod to kind of the generation that we're looking and currently we're so much is digital.

Right wasn't that 2014 a scare that cat head. I was like, oh my gosh that was so to address the Jacqueline's wearing.",ant

Obviously if you can tell us you if you can't no worries, but is this something that the writers told you the background of the story of their relationship and where it was going to go or is it something that you kind of had to kind of configure yourself in leaving that bit of a little bit of Mystery?",ant
3240," Then their life gets better if they don't nothing changes and I think that's kind of Jaclyn. I mean in the sense that she offers her perspective and it usually is right it's rarely wrong and and and it is informed. It's an informed perspective from experience from age from you know, just just the years of struggles of failures and successes that she's had and so, you know, it's fun to watch how the characters do.",ant

I'm just letting you know what he does and how it's been successful for him because he realizes that the customer he's the customers the one he's got to keep happy. Not the manufacturer. The customer. The customer is the one that's paying him money. It's embarrassing to go back six months a year later year and a half later to deal with an evaporator. That's leaking and say hey I,bee

So I had one unit off and the room was still at 70 degrees. So it was awesome. So we want to have a discussion on checking systems without using gauges and this is kind of close to my heart because I've been forced to do this over my career and I'm,bee

So I'm going to I'm going to tell you why I've been forced to do this and the first time and then I'll let you go on and let you explain how your measure quick non-invasive test works and get go into more detail about it. So,ant

I was on the tail end of the you know, six to eight your equipment 90 or equipment. I mean literally when I was graduating from Vocational School in the 80s is when they came out with a tensor well before that, you know, in fact it's interesting if occasional school. I never even learned the vacuum pump right because we just didn't have to do that that off that are maybe my instructor was lame. I'm not sure one of the two.",ant

You don't Prospect your fingers and you don't you don't you don't introduce contaminants into the,ant
3562," No, and if you have you asked guys well, okay, you just measured voltage, you know, it's got voltage because it's running. So what did you measure the voltage for and then is the voltage to eyers it too well and what's safe what's allowable range for that voltage? What's allowable range for the temperature? You look at measure quick. One of the things we do is every measurement we take for the most part very few exceptions has it has a Target so that you understand that, you know, an air conditioner the return air.",ant
3563, eventually the,bee
3564, And I know what the line temperature should be. Then that's all I got to do. That's all non invasive testing is just looking at at driving forces and the resulting temperatures that are going to come from that so if we have let's just say standard 2-ton residential unit and someone pulls up for a p.m. How long would it take them to start to finish like fire up the app and going through this test and getting the results that they're looking for.,bee

So when you're looking at you don't have Blanks on your gauges and also for technicians when you do hook up the gauges that you're going to see what we told you that the pressures were within a, you know, 1 2 PSI at what we have what we thought they would be and they're I mean, they're always very very close. So within a few PSI and what you really need, will everything we do in measure quick is actually based on saturation temperature. So if you ever look at a temperature pressure chart, you'll notice that typically on the low side.",ant
3571, I know I'm going to a hundred percent because it was so solid. And the moral of the story is listen guys gauging up is not necessary every time you you walk up to a system on a p.m. I've been doing this for years not as technically sound as Jim explained it.,ant

I shut the pump off during the evacuation and I never had any Decay which is good for the system side. Yes, but it also told me the pump is not letting any are back in either.

Well because on the blower came on all of a sudden we started making massive amounts of condensate and then we back up in the condensate drain and it just happens to be it. Looks like there's a crack in a heat exchanger because we're seeing the CEO start to rise at the same time the Border came on but we didn't stop and think that my flue gas just dropped down dramatically in temperature when my blower,bee

So so let let's say we walk into a machine room or mechanical room and like what are we going to expect to see and rack Refrigeration like to take us through that as a visual so",ant

So let's say for instance a rack a typical rack is going to have between four to eight compressors depending on how much of the store is serving. You're going to have a medium Tempo rack and generally most of your store is going to be medium tip. Your low temp is going to be your freezers.",ant
3884, And we're going to use our scale for on the dewpoint side 425 degree rack plus 25 medium Tempo 7f we're going to want the section set point to be 52 PSI. So the computer on the suction group is going to be set to 52 PSI all the time. So those compressors all eight of those compressors or however many of them are their job is to all run in order to maintain,ant
3885, There's different ways of doing that yet. And that's a good question. Very good question on that particular on the rack. Like I mentioned there's a lot of different branch lines. So you're going to have like any other system you're going to have two pipes going out to that case you're going to have you can have a liquid line and you can have a suction line coming back to the rack. Yep. So there's two different there's two different ways to control in that case the old school way and probably a lot of guys out there will still see this on some of the older things is the thermostat in the case and the liquid line solenoid valve either at the Kaiser.,bee
3886," to put this on epr kind of takes the plate of a suction stop even though they can be a dual purpose valve. If you have an epr it's going to maintain a constant temperature rather than having to open and close the refrigeration on that case. It just constitutes a constant pressure. So you don't necessarily have to always shut the case down with by shutting off isil annoyed. There's a lot of different ways of doing this, but you can you can kind of you can make it so that there's a liquid line.",ant
3887, To be condensed into liquid. So we're going to get a pretty good chunk of liquid coming back to the rack at one time. So as we do that that's going to affect a few things and remembers can become a back initially through the suction lines. So it's going to raise suction pressure because it's the distances from the cases to the rack to those compressors. There will be obviously time for the liquid to to expand and most of the to turn to Vapor.,ant
3888," I mean, I'm sorry go out to cases and at the case it'll basically enter the suction line after the suction stock and it will have its own still annoyed. And basically it turns it basically sends hot gasses do the system backwards sends it through the Section and it comes in and basically starts the latent heat starts to basically change the condition of the vapor into a liquid in the evaporator and you start to chemo",ant
3889," Actually enter it and you could actually get in the tunnel with the piping and follow it if you had to case you have a leak in there. But yeah, the old school way was to trench it out put all your piping underground and then take it to the back and then bring it up to the mechanical room or the motor room. But more and more these days. I see it run overhead. So they'll build a builder case from especially from the center of the store if that's where your frozen food cases are and they'll have it come down from overhead.",ant
3890," Related it's really well taped all the scenes and then after time no matter how well insulated it is the installation will saturate with water and especially after many many cycles of freezing the pipe and Indie frosting freezing and defrosting you'll start to get that stuff rather than either wearing through and then you'll be walking through the store and all of a sudden you get a nice cold drink of water on your head no matter who you are you looked up and yeah, it's time to re-inflate the piping. Yeah and some some of these stores Let It Go way.",ant
3891," So for me Supermarket Refrigeration is going to challenge you mentally because there's so many moving parts. And if you like that kind of thing, it might be the thing for you to do.

So thin that I don't have any really really deep friendships with anyone and I just have like very superficial friendships with a lot like hundreds of people, you know what I mean? So I think you do have to know those sometimes when you don't speak every day. It doesn't mean that you're not friends. Also, it just means that you know, just you're not as close as you used to be which is fine, you know, we grow up and that's what happens. So that's what I think about that.",ant

I remember and I laughed at the question because I don't store them. They're actually just all over my apartment as we speak. So if anyone has any like creative ways to store earrings, like I used to have one of those like earring like post things that you like, you know stick the earrings in I don't have one of those currently I should probably find another one.

This girl on Instagram asked me to write a tattoo for her and I try to do as many of these as possible. I get so many requests that it's like it's physically impossible for me to keep up with all of them, but this girl asked me and I was just randomly happened to be looking at my DMs and I'm glad I did because this concept was so compelling me.

She knew she was the most famous woman in the world and the sex is the most sought after on the other hand. She always thought this is the day they're going to find out I'm a fraud and so she we have the same press agent and he would tell me that sometimes she'd be two hours late to a press conference because she'd be literally getting sick and and how I watched her film Some Like It Hot that was the first time I met her and she,ant

You kind of tend to cut that chapter out and when you reflect you kind of are like, nope, I'm just gonna skim right over that one. You know. It's like when you're watching a show or a movie and you've already seen the movie before and you're like, I just want to skip through the bad parts and skip to the good parts. Honestly. I didn't notice that I was like that with movies especially until I started watching some stuff with like my sister the other day and I just had this weird feeling where I was like, I need to skip through this part.

It was just it was a very sobering period of time and I also was just reminded of this one phrase that I heard like over and over when I was in high school, you know, would your younger self be proud of the person that you are like if I talked to young little ten-year-old Katie who was just discovering herself or maybe tens little too young but like I don't know younger Katie like talking to her or like just like looking and seeing what she",ant

But anyway, she's also really under the radar but she wrote this article for Al and I read it and basically there were a couple of points as she made in the article that I was like damn. I agree with this and one of them was the second thing that she learned I actually wrote it down because I wanted to include it and this works perfectly with what I'm talking about.",bee

4838, it's really a weird one. Right? No completely understandable. See what about you? What was the question again? What are you most surprised about so far at the time of recording for the NBA free agency?

He left the NBA into that. He wanted getting money. That was actually great. It's okay. So everybody is mad about like Terry,ant

So it's really scary because you see like the trans bathroom Bill come into play a lot where it's like people say that trans people are predators and there's never been like a reported case of a trans person being a predator, but now people like Jessica can come out and people have an example to set people are saying",leech

So at the end of the day, I think we both agree on the fact that you have to put yourself first in the situation and it's hard to cut those people off like your friends or your family that you've had for tens of years. But at the end of the day you have to just think like if this person isn't going",bee

I just want people to respect me and that sometimes I can be like a really really hard battle to go through.

5322, To the beach or go to the pool like those simple things out like people do to have fun are so hard when you have a dysphoric episode because like constantly think people are talking about you and looking at you and your significant others often times.

5323," Pain that you're experiencing and when they don't understand it's like it's so difficult because you know, I don't really have that in my life.

And so like like I end up just like moving that leg pain moving that like that all that I'm feeling to like someone like my girlfriend who has to go through like so much because I'm just venting it all to her. And so it's yeah, it's definitely a hole",ant

So it's just it's hard to put yourself before other people because I think the last thing that any of us wants to be as alone and not to have anybody support you but like we were saying earlier like even if you do lose a few people, these are people that you really didn't need in your life because I don't support you 100% and going into that. You'll also meet people who are a hundred.",bee

I'm almost at my four year mark.

5338, Feel the same way and I have a story to kind of go along with this but this was me pre-transition. This was me before my transition. So I don't really have a lot to say when it comes to dating after you've transitioned because I started dating my girlfriend pre HRT pre hormones preemie identifying as a girl and luckily.

So the next question is I was or they said I was talking such date.",bee

I think the the main thing the big thing that you need to do is just see like a trans person and just think of them as a cyst person think of them as a normal another person that you're dating because at the end of the day, that's what they are. So I don't think you have to like necessarily tiptoe around anything. I would just treat them as if you're dating like anyone else but if there are those times where you guys get personal you're talking",ant

So I'm going to make a gauge say it because she has it I think on her DMS and then hell yeah, I'll be the first one to answer and then she'll give her opinion. Okay. So the last question is basically I've heard a number of people within the trans communities say that they somewhat prefer to date a trans person.",ant

So my score for those of you that don't know or haven't heard is I've been playing disc golf for about 18 years started when I was in high school walking up to a local course. It was next to our house was playing with my dad was playing with some friends and that kind of stuff, but we weren't taking it serious at all. We were just going up to get some exercise. Have a good time.",ant

Probably not because they would have at that one.",bee
6156," For sure, and we'll hit on some more topics with tips and that kind of stuff and maybe even expand a little bit more as we get into our weeks and that kind of stuff. We were super fortunate this week to be able to sit down with one of Washington's best disc golfers. Honestly, one of the most talented disc golfers in the world. He's my buddy for sure. I know Justin's played with him Chandler fry Chandler is been on tour for the last couple years and honestly,",bee
6157," I feel fine my flow. I just gotta believe in myself. I have a network my mental game a little bit. But I think once those all come together whenever they do I'll definitely be a force to be reckoned with for sure. Now, you've gone through three different major sponsors. If I'm correct, you were with Innovative star and then latitude for the last couple years. And then last year you made the switch over to this craft. What makes them so special kind of what's your stance with them and what separates this craft to you from anyone else? Yeah. I'll start by saying I think I found",ant
6158," Out the importance of your brand when it comes to staying on the road. Absolutely. The the brand is everything. You know, like if you have a good brand you have income, you know, we have a lot of players like Nate Sexton need Perkins Paul Macbeth Ricky wysocki who are just hustling, you know, then what wysocki brand the section shootouts the Perkin Perkins playoffs, you know stuff like that that are just people know their name when it comes to disc golf. There's somewhat of a household name. So I think if people recognize your brand, they're more likely to",ant
6159," If I can definitely bounce some stuff out maybe having a more of a solid mental approach to kind of everything. Yeah, I didn't didn't know that about you. I myself all the way through High School play the drums. So we may have to get together sometime. Well, I'm in let's get some drum circles going.",bee
6160," That plague the disc golf but it's also awesome. Did you see one of your buddies is out there tearing it up and pushing you for everything that he's got. Yeah, and for the people who don't know the Oregon state championship is played at Trojan Park and that's just a grueling course with water on probably 15 or the holes. So just being able to play good golf. There is definitely shows that he's got the talent to compete just about anywhere and he's doing it on tour now, so yeah, definitely",ant
6161," Yeah, you definitely had a strong finish last year and I mean Vegas is definitely one of the best ways to start a season or really just have a good vacation with your friends and and play disc golf at the same time a hundred percent agree. It's definitely something that I'm looking forward to I know that we're flying down there getting you know, your rental cars and your Airbnb place and that kind of stuff and if if anyone that's listening hasn't played the Las Vegas challenge. It's on a golf course. There's a lot of videos on YouTube and that kind of stuff from",bee
6162," I first started we didn't we didn't necessarily have that. So I think instead yeah good thing to have. Yeah these days I would totally totally agree with that too. I knew we're both definitely with the age that we grew up in self-taught players. Very were. Yeah, you watch people that you played with or whatever but you didn't necessarily have YouTube to fall back on lots of events, right? You've traveled all over the place. Yeah. Yeah of all those events and all the years that you've played. What's your most memorable?",bee
6163," For this craft I was I was catty and I was just I went there hoping to play hoping that my elbow would just magically just repair itself. It did not but I was there so I definitely don't want to miss it. Then I'm not playing at this year. But Prince Edward Island the Canadian championships. Okay, that's probably one of my favorite horses. And that was the hurricane remnants of the hurricane that we're coming through last year. Correct. Yeah, I was up there is Hurricane. I figure with the hurricane was never remember which one",ant

So I wanted to help her out and kind of I don't think anyone really when I was first starting. My dad was my only support, you know, yeah. I want her to know that the older School old school disc golfers are still there and still want to help her out, you know, so I just it's just an apparel disc sponsorship right now, but I hope to grow it in the future and hopefully have a five or six Juniors and we can potentially do",bee
6165, I mean you brought an avocado for breakfast for a tournament. So like I've got it you're on that Tom Brady diet level. So I well I eat a lot of protein make sure that your fuel with carbs and protein so you don't crash in the middle of the round and kind of have a snack that is not too sugary during the round so you can least get the last seven eight holes in without being hungry.,bee
6166," Yeah, sure. So I'm carrying the octave Thorpe. I got hooked up with the pound sponsorship last year. There's no bag that's made better than the pound bag Levi puts tons of thought into it. They go through changes every year to make them better. He's so busy making bags right now that they can barely even keep up but it is the only company at least the only company I'm aware of that. You can just customize your own bag with colors and stuff. They look super sweet. I'm actually on my second pound bag because I had one",bee
6167," You know, it came through the sport of ultimate. So I as a little baby my parents played ultimate and I would be like on the sidelines of games and stuff. So I'm told I was thinking four hands before I could talk. So I think that was like the beginning of Frisbee for me. And as long as I can remember we are always kind of like, you know would have a frisbee around if we went on a raft trip or something we'd have them and we throw them between the rafts and just have like we'd play camping trips me and my brother.",ant
6168," I'm doing it more of a local level you're winning big events out on the road or doing your best to do so every once in a while. Yeah, the game's changed so much in the last 10 years or so. We talked to Chandler about that. He referenced reading a Scott are seeing a Scott Stokley VHS tape is the first thing that he experienced, you know, part of staying on the road part of something that you've been so successful with this building your own brand it started with the maquis challenges and then you went to the sexton shootout.",ant
6169," Talk about the tournament scene a little bit. Well, let's focus on the EM side of this most of the people that are listening to this are probably going to be recreational to amateur to Advanced players. What's one event that every amateur players should go to at least once in their life, like location tournament staff that experience the courses and such like what something that no employer should Miss, huh? I would say, you know, there's it depends how serious you are. I would say there might not be one tournament for all the",ant
6170," This is going to be my first event that's coming up in like five or six weeks. It's quick and I'll be playing the memorial as well. My schedules looking like about 15 tournaments probably almost all of them doing the big sexy thing with Jeremy calling and Joe Mez. So I'll be pretty much traveling, you know, exclusively by airplane these days because I got to get back and do my dad thing as soon as I can when when I get home because Breeze schedule as a first-year resident is",ant
6171, Duo from Joe Mez going it's something where I kind of grew up playing and idolizing and wanting to have my game be like Nate's and then they have all been to their own and obviously I developed into a little more of a power player and not quite as technical as mate is for the courses that you play in Oregon his game suits perfect for him. And that's why he has as much success as he did before he kind of went on the road full term.,ant
6172, He'll with some obstacles in the way like we did what we could to set it up where the course is scorable for whoever plays good. But at the same time there's enough challenge to make it where you have to be able to throw every shot in the bag.,ant
6173," To be honest, the Oregon Disc Golf Scene is filled with excellent tournament directors. We are super lucky to have what we have all around the Northwest just every tournament you go to you know, that it's going to be top-notch and if they're not they kind of fade out because there's so many good options within the state. And so if you are one of those tournament directors that's running the successful be tears are see tears or bigger. I mean I know going up to the BC open going to Farragut other things that you would consider in the Northwest the tournament",bee
6174," The Minnesota I believe but is currently in Phoenix. So we'll get to that a little later in the podcast. First thing I want to hit on is how to practice how to get better. What's it look like we've done a lot of talking the last few weeks about tournaments and about tournament preparation and about mental game and that kind of stuff but when you go out during the week and you're playing disc golf, are you doing it with the intent to get better for one and then how for to so, what does that look like for you?",ant
6175," I mean you're locked in like there's no distractions. If you're at the course at eight in the morning by yourself, like you said you could practice all the shots you want and no one's going to be standing on the tee pad behind you. Wondering what the hell you're doing. And why aren't you finished yet? Are you when you're playing by yourself? Are you a music guy? Do you put your headphones in and just kind of spaced out or what? Does that look like for you? I'm definitely rocking out 100% when I'm by myself sometimes even when",ant
6176," Yeah, when you stop fearing 20-footers, you'll make more 40-footers. You don't have to worry about the comeback. Right? And I think that's something that you see is your I don't get enough spin on my pot from 40 to have 20 Footers coming back a lot of times and you're kind of in that same boat with me. But yeah, the better you are from 20 the easier 40-footers become because you're not worried about having to make the comeback but",ant
6177," Yeah, and that's a good point if people you are serious and getting better and you need to reach out to a local Pro. Don't be shy like sending me a message since got a message. I'm happy to give you a tip or meet up with you and throw some holes and just you know were friendly people ask us for help. Yeah for sure be understanding that we have lives and jobs and stuff too, and I can't meet you at one o'clock on a Thursday. But if the time does work out if you can make time in your schedule, I know that I love",bee
6178," Don't lose bets. This is what we do. We're dumb guys. I'm sure Dallas would love to tell you that story. Maybe I'll get them on the podcast some time to tell the story about how that all went down a battle it bachelor last year, but as we get ready for Vegas, we're going to play with some big guys big names if you go out there and do it, right who's your favorite pro to play with Justin and then if you're not playing with them, who's your favorite one to just watch?",ant
6179," he's on all these and move on which is kind of how the Vegas course is used to play and they've adapted some since then, but it was the only situation where I was looking at these tolls and looking at the shots and being like",ant
6180," memorable story from a fan or someone you stayed with around the country. That would be like the most memorable thing anyone's ever done for you. Um, I think it varies like a lot of people like ask me for my address just like it's crazy because like they'll send me dis they'll send me like packages just like just random stuff but like Montana is a huge thing our host makes us feel special and just like Cooks every meal just like not even asking us like what we wanted to surprise us and it's get our own room and stuff. It's like royalty.",bee
6181," to be the best obviously, so I think it's been huge for me just like impact off the course to see the results on the course. Sure. What's a what's a daily workout routine look like for you. Oh, I think it just varies on the day. Usually like right now. I'm just like I'll make breakfast and kind of go into the gym or whatever then start with some just stretching then kind of do some some muscle strength test or whatever to see how my body feels do some cardio. So it just varies then like do some resistant bands agility.",bee
6182," Actual to you. That's a smaller stop on some you'll be playing. What's your favorite stop on tour? What's one thing that you look forward to every year and maybe why is that the case? Um, it's like obviously you have Zoo Town you have Vermont you have like Nantucket. Yep, Portland. All those tournaments are sweet, but it's just like usually like it's the first tournament of the year. Just kind of get see everybody again because like we all spend a few things all over the different places of the country to so like being at the first event showing up a few days early and seeing",bee

So I'm excited to see what he does with MVP plastic and I wish the guy the best of luck and we'll see him like I talk to him about a minute ago. We'll see him in Vegas in a few weeks and hopefully we can catch a practice round with him or something. But definitely very glad to have him on the show little spoiler alert next week. We are going to have our first duel interviewer going to have two people at the same time.,bee
6184," Kind of stuff. Yes, you get older. You know, we got plenty of good golf left in us. We're both in our young will say young 30s at this point young to mid 30s at this point. Eventually the Young Guns are going to take over sure. I've seen it already you see kids that are coming in and you got Eagle you got Kevin and a million other. Yeah. I want you to 24 year olds that are out lighting it up right now. I'm going to put you on the spot five years from now who are the top three players in the world.",ant
6185," What the feeling really is? Like I pretty much take any chance. Anybody wants to give me to talk about that man. It was a pretty incredible. It just sort of felt like for me, you know going into that season. I had just before that few months before that. I had decided to buy a $70,000 RV and a trailer and take my three month old daughter and my wife on the road with me disc golfing and it was kind of like, you know jumping into",ant
6186," And not really surprising that I shoot my best round and then still lose to you by Two Strokes for for the first round. So that's always entertaining. So, but tell me tell me how your first round went. So I knew it was good, right I started on whole one tournament director not warming up at all. You get to start on whole one. That's the perks because well you honestly don't walk out to the Tee Box until the two-minute warning gets called went out there and I never played the course either even though I set him up I'd throw in a couple of the holes, but it",ant
6187," Over the last four or five years on tour has been contending a big tournaments and everything and then I feel like I'm very comfortable in the lead. That's where I want to be. I want to get through that first round and have a couple shot lead so I can put pressure on so you're in kind of a weird spot because yeah, you're trying to win the tournament, but you're also trying not to get caught for many one that's behind you and in the two round tournament. There's no separation going into that final round. It's just a Sprint for 36 holes the start of the second round Dustin and I threw great drives and greater.",ant
6188," Under a tree where I was throwing this super high Annie for hand from like 60 feet and trying to have a hover down right next to the basket. Like it was a super weird place to end up got up and down and it was just like, okay, you did something good. Let's roll if you want to win this tournament. You're going to find out how to make some birdies here real quick because we know these courses are kind of Birdie or die. Yeah. I kind of felt the same pressure from Dustin.",ant
6189," I knew you would win the water and at that point I'm like, okay, we only have four holes to go. It's essentially a two-person race after you had thrown in the water. And then thankfully I was able to step up and throw my star stud right next to the basket tap-in move on and I knew at that point that the holes that we had left there was to par 3s in whole 14 and 16 that aren't variables. I knew they were too long. It takes a really special shot to get a birdie on either though. So I'm thinking like, okay. Those are both par holes on Two Shots up.",ant
6190," It's just that around the table and watch the 49ers like Smackdown to Packers. So that was that was a lot of fun to just catching up with everyone and talking disc golf. Yeah, this is a weird year for me. Usually the Patriots are playing in the AFC Championship game and I'm a huge Pats fan, but it took a little pressure off me that they weren't maybe it's the end of my Tom Brady era will see I'm sure the listeners will have some hate for me for being such a big Tom Brady fan. I don't really care. But yeah, it was it was a different experience not having",bee
6191," You back and then what you said about Dustin he was talking to me about how you know, my backhand putter shots have really improved but I still rely on my forehand, but I kind of need to trust my back and more especially like whole 14 where I force that that forehand shot that through in the pond where everyone else in the car through a simple putter back in like I need to just be able to realize hey, this is a putter back and shot and not force.",bee
6192, At the end of the first round I got stung in the ankle by a bee and my ankle is like twice the size. It should have been and then I shall like a 960 around or something in the second round. I would like 10 6960 on the first day or some ridiculous and you came out super hot in the second third rounds and build the big lead and then ended up holding Justin's yours off in the playoff at back West.,ant

6197, I am super excited for this event been putting in a ton of time ton of effort to make sure that it's as good as it can be for all the players that are involved. It looks like the weather is going to cooperate maybe highs in the upper 50s doesn't look like it's going to get too cold on Saturday night. So the course might be a little wet. We've seen it when out there a couple weeks ago to try to set things up. So it may be a little sloppy and places but the weather looks fantastic all we can ask for in January. I'm going to start by just giving a thank you to some of the sponsors that make,ant
6198," Whole six plays off of the golf course property just a little bit into an open field. The you've got a big group of Hedges on the right that you definitely don't want to go into. I guess they're not really Hedges their kind of bushy trees. But those trees eat discs really bad. If you get in there you're asking for a bogey. It's a little bit of a low cover tee shot and then the basket sits on top of a little bit of a hill. That's pretty flat on the right side, but falls down pretty significantly on the left. You definitely want to stay straight or right of the basket, but not go in those bushes.",ant
6199, As a super cool green the holes going to play about 300 feet. It is the basket is in a Grove of trees. So the basket will have Guardian trees that are probably about 20 feet from it on all sides. It is fair. There's a gap to get in but if you don't hit the Gap you're going to be hoping that you have a putt in the farther away you are it may make up shots a little tricky. If you don't throw a good drive and then hole 18 traditional par-4 to end about 600 feet. You're going to want to crush a drive out there. The bigger arms are going to throw mid range or,bee
6200," Plenty of room to crush your going across the Fairway and then the basket plateaus up onto a golf tee pad. That's a really cool putting area. There's a bunker short left that comes into play a green that could come into play if you saw your second shot off a little bit. It's a fun whole really cool whole you'll see one or two birdies for hole in your top groups on this may be one and the lower groups and if you are one of those accuracy and not Power Players, you may be throwing two drives and then a layup to take your par whole 11, maybe the signature hole on the",ant

And yes, it's going to be a big transition but Russell Westbrook realizes that this is an actual chance for him to win a final. So my prediction is that he takes a backseat of James Harden plays really good defense. Does this thing in the Fast Break gets a lot of rebounds plays really? Well when James Harden is not in the game. He takes the takes the Houston Rockets.",ant

It's one thing if you have one point guard like OKC's got Che Gil just Alexander. They got one point guard was at least for now. We think they're going to trade Westbrook, right but or we or that you have two guys, so you either going to have to stick Bradley and cook our Bradley and Danny Green on the floor together and suffer offensively.

I think anything bad I said then is pretty much unknown like you don't know that this could turn into a Kevin Garnett Paul Pierce, but I think those you can't really compare that.

Like I just don't see how it could work. Like we're talking about Bradley Beal and John Wall trying to go to Miami and the only way Miami was going to have did enough to trade for Bradley Beal. This was to take John Wall. We have another absurd trade that would doubt. I was thinking about it. That would be the most",bee
7138," Make sense to me at all. Well, I don't get the whole like careful argument because you know, this is not NBA game experience necessarily but it isn't it is game. It is game experience against professionals that are good basketball players and like you I at the end of the day you're drafting these guys to get them to be the best basketball players you can be and I think going to the summer league in playing in the summer league is really valuable experience because when you go to training camp, like you've already got some of that experience playing against guys that are not just like college teams.",ant

I'm well, I'm going to I'm going to go in order of like how they progressed right? So my number one thing is before the sales call and that's they don't have any pre-qualification setup. Listen guys. You're closing rate will be 0 if you get on the phone with the wrong person every single time like and that's nothing that's not your fault.

So I really just just even when you're coaching your own clients, even if it's health and wellness, like a lot of times people are asking the question. They already know the answer. They already know what the answer is. They just kind of need you to challenge them to say it themselves. So that's just another good lesson right there that you kind of were saying to which I think is great. So love that awesome. I feel like I always say that to my clients to like some kinda",ant

I don't think some people realize that like highest level is actually from Mastermind like a mix of one-on-one in a group.

7530," Listen to that episode definitely go back and listen short. It's like 20 minutes. I share a little bit about my story where I got started with business. So I got started in network marketing with Beachbody in 2011. I signed up November 2011. I will never forget it but I did what a lot of people do. I kind of flailed around and I said, oh I'm going to be a Beachbody Coach. Yay. I'm gonna make so much money. And then I did nothing. I like didn't actually work much.

This is what happens with most people and that's what happened when they it took off and then all of a sudden the next year we more than doubled that so we went from about 50 k 225 okay in",bee
7532," One outside of beach body but that like October November December was really tough. And so this is where see I told you I try to keep things short, but you know, this is where this switching Industries comes because I was half-and-half. I was half in my business with Beachbody, which it was a six-figure business. So my head I'm like I can't just let that go like that's my that's my livelihood. You know, that's like we rely on that and so in my head it was kind of like my 9 to 5. So if you're in a nine-to-five you can totally relate to",ant

I've had business coaches like I had the experience I went to school for business, although honestly,",ant
7534," My clients have incredible results. So I knew boom those two were you know a hell no for the first question and then a hell. Yes for the second question. And that's when I went. Okay those two we're going for it. So those are the biggest things you got to ask yourself and you got to be really honest because I see a ton of people specifically a lot of health and fitness coaches who switch to business coaching, which is very natural. Like I get it I did the very similar thing but like I said network marketing is a lot of business. So I feel like network has already have that business.",ant
7535, Of that was my secret sauce. And that's like the stuff. I love I'm still going through life coaching school. I'm going to finish it. It's going to taking me a while because life's busy but I love it. I love it. Love it. Love it. And even though I'm not technically going to use it to just life coach. It's hands-down impacted my coaching. It's made me such a better Coach. It's made me a more patient human in general and I ask better questions. I listen I listen way better than I ever did.

Your business shouldn't consume your life. It should give you life. And so I just dismiss totally went on the tangent. This is not about switching Industries anymore.

And at the time that's what I thought was okay, in addition to building this, you know million dollar network marketing Empire that I thought I was gonna build I'm going to also do my own thing on the side. So I started to dabble in that I started to think about what I could sell what I could you know do on the side all that stuff and didn't really do much and then July 2017 finally took the plunge and invest it in my first real real investment. I invested $6,000 in a man.",bee

7542, 20 by the end of this year what needs to happen What needs to change we're talking about this a lot with the team this weekend. Like what do you actually want to achieve in the next year? And why do you want that Financial Freedom? Do you want to start saving for a house? Do you want to not have to freak out when you go to the grocery store and have to save a ton of money and look at your account before you go like what is the purpose of all this? Why do you even want to build a business and then I really want you to dive deep into do you want to change that story?,ant
7543," They say they need and this is what I know. I can help them with that is step one. Okay, crucial mistake. Number two sales calls mistakes. So number two in my opinion reason people big mistake. They make when trying to sign clients besides not providing enough free value and not having a plan or a strategy is they only speak to the stuff that people are going to get and not the transformational experience, right? So I want you to think about this way if I'm advertising client attraction.",bee
7544, Consume tons of free value free information YouTube all that stuff and I did a lot on hard worker. I did do a lot on my own but I realized that if I was going to really be consistent and have make this happen faster. I didn't want it to take 10 plus years that I needed that accountability. I needed that support I needed at system. And until I did that my like dream to build an insanely profitable business kind of just stayed in my head and that didn't help anyone that didn't help my business. It didn't help my bank account and help my family didn't help.,ant
7545," Lack of enthusiasm and most of them only paid for a few sessions, which meant that my income went up and down real fast, and I wanted to just get off of that roller coaster ride so badly, but every solution out there was either a high ticket one-on-one coach. I couldn't afford or some random course that offered zero support and I knew investing was part of what would help it take off, but I didn't want to be on the line for huge lump sum of cash every month to a coach because I honestly didn't know if I would make that money back on the flip side. I didn't want to be in",ant

I was someone who had struggled with an eating disorder for the majority of my life. And when I was in high school was the first time I was ever trying to get help and that's when I was seeing the child and youth counselor at the school at the time. And so I had decided in my mind. That's it. That's what I want to do. This is the only career for me and it was,ant
7547," Type of coach and kind of figuring out your Niche a little bit more or switching. I mean Megan you did that too, right? Yeah multiple times. I think what's interesting is that you know, I can sit here and be mad about oh, why did I do that? Degree it so much time on that and then why did I do Fitness? Oh my God, but if I didn't do those things I wouldn't have the education the background that I do now to do what I'm doing and I wouldn't so holistically understand my ideal client the way that I do now because I know her in her fitness journey",ant

I was like, okay, I'm going to post five times a week and I'm going to focus on the things that are actually really important to their Journey. So I had to reflect back on what when I was going through my experience with food and body. What were the post that really rang true to me? What did what resonated with me what excited me? What did I click on and guess what? It wasn't the photos of me on the bench don't like who's on.",ant
7549," - because people kind of just knew that that's what was going to come out of my mouth. They knew to expect that from me and you know, I don't know if vulnerability ever fully gets comfortable or easy, but I also don't think that that's the point I think when you choose to be online and to be a coach you're choosing to stand up for women who cannot stand up for themselves yet. And that's me is way more important than any piece of ego that I have about other people.",ant
7550," So stop complaining about it and get curious about why maybe it didn't it didn't reach more people and then shift in pivot and let it be an experiment. Don't let it be something to fuel your ego. Let it be something that has a purpose and is for service. Yeah, that's just such a good point. It's really as and and again we all fall trap to this. There's been moments where a post that I was like, oh, this is a great post and it gets okay engagement, but it's not like great and I feel bad. I know what why this is so insane.",ant
7551," Like I said because it's a game everything is data. So when I was doing post that were very similar to this kinds of posts that other people were making I'd be like, okay, why didn't mind perform? What can I tweak here? Because even though the image is from is a visual up. Maybe it's your hooker your caption. Maybe you were actually hitting deeply into their pain points. Maybe they weren't resonating with the specific topic that you chose to talk about. Maybe it's maybe coloring and imaging by the way guys if you don't have presets, please",ant

Because it worked so well for you. Yeah. Well even coming back to my career transition. I was doing a fitness account.

I guess against thinking it's passive because that's something that so many people think is like I'm gonna launch a membership is going to be super easy.

So if you can kind of give your like real take on like how much time you spent building it and what the results have been like what it's grown to.

So starting a fast earlier in the evening is going to be a lot easier for me.

Well, I'm not sure if we even got onto the first project, but obviously you talking about these plants that were going up where you base predominately on site or was this a office-type gig or what was it? So office-based, you know while we're doing, you know the concept design and",leech

7792," Enough to give people a bit of an idea. Can you explain a bit about that? It's a bit hard to put it in a nutshell. It was really just the managing of the extra the people underneath you. So, you know, I got a couple of project Engineers that were working under me. So I delegated some of my roles to them. But it meant that I went along to a few of the higher level sort of meetings and stuff. I very much Lee became the second in command to the the power project manager.",ant
7793," But it's simple down-to-earth sort of advice that people can just put into actionable as well. Yeah, so it's a huge piece of advice that you know for anybody that's just starting out and get your finances sorted and just saw them right now. If you just started your first gig and you're getting your first big paycheck and you saw them right now, you're going to save yourself hundreds of thousand dollars by the time you retire and if you can keep those University spending habits going what whilst I'm not saying.",ant

I'm very reactive than that in that aspect and I really need I was explaining to Warrant the star this episode. I fair that I'm need a structure. I need to follow a project management plan or something like that to ensure that I achieve all the outcomes and that to me sounds like a perfect technique in doing that. So yeah Rapids full of little tips and tricks and hacks like that that you know, yeah and and and we said offer as well.",ant

Absolutely so so Keen for this? We've had a few speeches and presentations but for us, this is really the Crux it's going to be such an awesome event to be involved in and really to be able to reach as many people as we are there. We're really hoping to connect with a lot more Engineers who can share their stories.",ant
7802," Little bit but can you explain a little bit to us? Who is Ruth Harrison and how you came to be? Oh, well, I don't think you want to go right back to how I came to be very reserved. We you know weeks and fulfilling all that and and yeah, so I'm English which a lot of people",ant

It's also about you know, if you anything you do comes back to the connects, you know, people say, oh I know such and such from down the street, you know, they've done something naughty and they can't they go back to the cadets and go why is this person doing this? So it's about getting people used to that because it's the same in the forces, you know, people know that",bee

I was always the one that drank the most when we went out, you know, I was always had to beat the guys, you know, I had to do everything better or yet be more I had to be more bubbly. I had to be more. Oh, you know, yeah, it'd be more Curious. Yeah, definitely and so it was a great time. I don't get me wrong. I think being a student is fantastic.",ant
7806," Don't think they know things think I don't know things. But you also need to know so much more than you could ever imagine and you know, and you can't know all of that solutely. So you've got it. You've got a link into your network and I think that's not something Engineers do very well. I think they're getting better and I think social media has helped because people can connect from the behind the screen actually have to physically make exactly and it also means that the vents on all start so, you know Word of Mouth anymore so you can find out what's going on and you get involved in things.",ant
7807," dinner at Space Engineering and I love playing games. And so that was that was always a kind of a given but it was when I kind of left and you know while you're doing your degree, it's all that this kid over radio got to do these got a new got this be the coursework got it, you know, you're living that we've got to go to go to Sainsbury's and work on the deli counter tonight because I need to make some money to pay for that about that's going to be like, I've got and the bees and and the train ticket back home and you know and all of those things he was very different to the way it is now, you know, I'm no no,",ant

So yeah, so and you know, there's a lot of really good Engineers that have come from overseas and they have worked in overseas difference even in the UK, you know, which you'd think you'd be easily transferable is not know and if they have to go and do their for five years somewhere else or wedding at the citizenship and that's actually really difficult because say you're I don't know weapons engineer, you know Munitions and you know or something in the UK.",ant
7809," Leti so ideally we're looking at three different streams of people people like myself who already have a degree in engineering but haven't used it and want to you know, use it down the track. So let's get them some opportunity whether it's through internships or you know, maybe some upscaling or what have you and people who have been out for an extended period so I've already had an engineering career but have gone to have kids or they've got only parents or whatever massive and also those people who have just want to have been a lawyer or been at, you know a nurse or",bee

So we like lost any network that we had in Melbourne. And so it's you know, it's a real Challenge and one that's you know, I face every single day is how do I manage where I've got to be and what I've got to do and who I need to speak to as well as you know, I can't have my little boy run.",ant

I'm getting an amazing training right now and getting to leave one of the property to one of the stages of the commercial development essentially for free. I work for no money. I don't get paid to do this. But the training I get is incredible and I kind of It kind of shocks me that there's not more companies out there offering these kind of things like for people to work for free for them, but game these insights and experiences. And yes, I get that the ghd's were today.",bee
7812," No, think about all the sentence should support she got the hex and all these other things that should go through uni degree if she never goes back to engineering it's never been utilized as just thrown down the toilet. So I think I think let's go back a bit though. I mean like engineering you can use it in a lot of other areas. So it's not quite a waste but it is it is sad to lose people. I don't I'm just saying I'm just saying I'm just saying she has kids and never return to the workforce again because she wants to stay in engineering and that doesn't work out she's not going to become a you know Runner like a sales sales woman or something like this.",bee
7813," Um, so that's that's also helped me a lot in my journey and I do just want to reiterate you know, whatever you do. Whoever you are. You do do a job that's value aligned because it's really important and it really takes away from you. If you're doing something that isn't doesn't match with your values of who you are. So yes, it just just be aware of that. If something isn't feeling right there's a reason for that. I love that point. Yeah. What a way to wrap it up Bruce Harrison. Thank you so much. Yeah. Well can we look forward to working with you very soon. I'm sure.",ant

I got a phone call from them and they were like or Melissa you've been on the books for a while. We've got some interest from an agency in Hong Kong. Could you go in two weeks? No way what an opportunity from bumming around at home, too. Let's go to Hong Kong. That's insane. Totally. I was like, yeah, did I feel like I just won the lottery",bee
7815," Just she was literally glowing over her work life. I could just see how fulfilling it was for her. And so that kind of won me over in the end well, and that's it at the end of the day if you wake up happy to go and do your work no matter what it is. And I mean who really cares whether you're sitting in the stinky office or a glamorous marketing suite at the top rather than off slogans. It's so good and I kind of wish I wish I kind of had that opportunity before I started engineering. Luckily. I've kind of fallen into something that I do really",bee

What do you think the ratio would be at an employer looking at that experience in terms of importance for employability? Yeah. So for me what I would look at is if they'd had I absolutely would want them to have real world experience. So that would up that would just be like a have to must have tick tick the Box. Yeah, and in terms of applying that ratio, what I would do is I'd want to ride",ant

I really see the town planner is almost that middleman between the council and the client being the developer type thing and and often times like I know our town planner at the moment does the amazing job even going and talking to the engineers or whoever it might be that needs to be consulted with and really almost runs the whole development application process would you say?",ant

Their business model is a something that in your experience that happens or am I just hearing whispers and rumors here? No, no, no. No, it happens. So there's a bit of a gamble with that because you never know which way the government's going to legislate but the fact is so you're right. And so this kind of thing happens, right? I've got a client the moment. He is a Hydroponics farmer and he's in been in Vineyard and",ant
7819," Look, it was great to go and do that and be passionate about and get out the rage and all of that and I do feel like I made some part of a difference, but for me, it wasn't sustainable because as you said the more that you look at the problems and more than just get bigger. Yeah. It's overwhelming. Yeah, and so what I'm really happy about now is I'm glad the climate change activism is still going on. It's kind of like passing the torch to it to someone else and I'm glad it's still going strong. But yet for me it wasn't like, okay. I'm going to commit to this.",ant

Yeah, I'd love to like I said before I started doing work experience at Uni and what I found was there was just such a big gap between what I was being taught at Uni and what I was actually doing on the job and that just really stuck with me that experience and I was lucky enough to work for a great company.

Oh, yeah, that's that actually counts. Like I really like that you've been doing this. Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely because they're going to understand the process of development applications, you know, and looking at it from an aside that you wouldn't get normally inside a firm objecting against a DA is another thing that you do.",ant

We need to talk about purpose and we need to build community. So my work is really related to how can we change the story of engineering industry.

Yeah, he runs his own little business doing things like car parks and houses and structural engineering and all kinds of stuff and he has a real passion for earthquakes and things like that. So we would like pour over maps of Victoria and the geology and geography here and he just love teaching and I love learning. So this great match really so I would help him in AutoCAD as well. I did a lot of drafting for him. I did calculations of beans and moments and",bee

I was in a jazz band dealers kind of and I did my work experience and things like that and it really kind of hit home in the last few years that the grades and not the be-all and end-all of success.

See you soon.",ant

And when you live in a society where your",bee
8667," I think I've you know you touched on it, but I find it interesting that you know, America is one of those places where we are trying to create that structure where like people especially like when the government's making decisions people. They're looking at Industries like ours and they're like, you know, you're going to have to pay the minimum is going to race but people don't realize that it's not just about that the whole ecosystem needs to change like Health Care has to be accessible for everyone and needs to be free.",ant
8668," And for me, it's an idea that okay. Look Beyond a restaurant as being the only place that that's going to get there's only so many restaurant towards are going to have you know, those three four five six restaurants that are generating enough, you know profit that they can sit back and let you know walk off into the sunset the rest of us usually grinding it out and I think that the shelf life of a cook and of a chef is a lot less than it is in most other Industries to be working.",ant

Like that's kind of like the that's the norm.",ant
8670," Report them lure, you know, that's not for me and I don't really care too much about that. So yeah, I think sometimes it's you know, the I think the short of that is like sometimes it's hard for there to be some kind of agency to summarize, you know that but that's why sometimes a discussion from people who are knowledgeable kind of can bring that the entire picture to light and just say, you know, I can't really speak for every dollar slice restaurant. Yeah, but I can tell you it costs a lot more than a dollar. You know it like to have a good slice of pizza.",ant

You can do that in different areas of people that I worked with eight years ago in the advertising business who are still in the advertising business and now they're like running the whole place right? So I think there are examples of both. It's just a matter of where do you want to go personally and and what's comfortable for you?,ant
8679," But it's just a it's who you are and who you are how you're built that plays a part of that, you know, and one of things I really like these to do is you know, even though there's a business that's operating with fairly consistent processes are still opportunities to go fix it and iterate it and used it raised the bar which you know, it sounds like that's a term over there. But again, I think people tend to get then stagnant and they get settled in and they said well, this is just how we do stuff but there's always a way to continue",bee

Let's think about some of your bigger failures or maybe a bigger failure that you can reflect on as a leader a pivotal moment. Maybe that you've gone through in your career. That's kind of taught you like",ant

I think this is a force vision and I think it's Disney's classic misdirection. I think we're reading too much into it. But that's just my take. I don't know.

So let's talk about Jack's time on the golf course because I feel like his was an overarching reason that trickled down into both young Randall and older Randall's situation on the golf course because we obviously saw previous episodes that Jack had a divide between Rebecca's father and himself.

And I feel like I was saying against this in the beginning but I do think that he's kind of making Nikki almost replace what his father cement and he's getting all of those like fatherly ties in Jack ties. And that's what he always really wanted because now since he no longer has acting now he's having Nikki feel bad like Jack void and but I'm here for it. I think it's great.

I'm this and like it's an honor, you know that I'm with you and I think that's where it's going to start her weight issues. And this could end up that could also be kind of a parallel story line with Tony K. Yeah. Oh that's very true. Because we ask them we did obviously didn't talk a lot about Kate tonight, but we did see the Polaroids that they brought up that they were taking pictures on and it was where she had that moment of like.

Yeah, no one like died and then came back to life. No. Yeah, but I did like this it felt more realistic felt more life based not always are people going to see exactly what you want them to see of you your perception of yourself or your family or your immediate family are not always what's perceived by the rest of the",bee
9339," It's interesting because you said the point about Rebecca making that comment to him like if he'd still been alive. He reconciled with you but for someone like Nikki from what I've seen I feel like that actually just added another thing to his list of what if ya like what if he was alive, would he have where maybe he had come to terms with the fact that his brother was alive. He had a family like that's why he said he was it was too hard and hurt too much because he finds out first that his brother is dead. And then I think even Rebecca adding that",ant
9340," Dad, maybe it is because if they're dead maybe they don't want to take him off that pedestal and by realizing and recognizing that he completely like ostracize his brother makes him less of their hero. That's so sad, especially if it is sad the situation. I mean he still responsible for what happened to the kid in Vietnam. But yeah, it wasn't intentional no and not to harp on this more but Randall knows how important it was to be all alone because his father William was all alone and how he was.",ant
9341," You've known nothing about this man for almost 40 Years of your life time and then all of a sudden he exists like and not really are you still yeah, you're mad at your husband, but you obviously trusted him with your life if he kept something from me, I would hope that there was reason enough for him to keep it from me. And obviously the kids had a different perspective because Nikki did explain that it was an accident.",leech
9342," Fastest thing. So it was that was cool to me. It's funny. I was having this conversation with my sister and she said that that's why because she looked this up like if my sister and I get an argument my older sister, we literally will told two different stories because everything's your perspective your opinion and obviously you're going to push your own opinion usually and then it said online something about that. So I like when cops and like it when something happens again incident happens and accident someone dying something they'll ask everybody around because they'll use together.",ant
9343," I don't know why we did it but literally just even driving by it kind of like took me back and so I can see why Randall and Kate wanted to go in there. But what threw me off as I said earlier is they wanted to connect with their dad. They wanted to go to the place to feel the memories to remember the sequence party, but they have a living part of Jack. It is like a part of Jack. I know it's so weird. Like Rebecca isn't a part of Jack Rebecca is just Rebecca. I know that they were soul mates and they loved each other, but then that's not a part of Jack.",ant
9344," As I said at the start. Yeah, exactly. I was really going strong of a set visit. I was loving it. I just know I'm Laura don't really to start. I don't really have one. Oh God, Lena. Yeah, Lena, go figure.",ant

He doesn't just handle things like so calmly and so I think he might feel like all right. I'm trying to be your shoulder to lean on but you're not being mine and it could lead to tension, but I hope that's not the reason they break up. I don't think that's the reason that they break up because it seems like they have to be around each other as a family for a while. And what I noticed about Jack is that he",bee
9348, you're sort of moments where he all of a sudden shows up at Nikki's doorstep and you're sort of wondering what's going to happen next week with that which will touch on later on but he's also just maturing a lot throughout this episode. He's taking care of baby Jack and learning how to hold a baby and that was a really moving moment. I noticed but it's funny that you talked about sort of parallel the way this episode paralleled their younger selves compared to now the way they are and it's interesting because,ant
9349," Contributes to that but also just a little jab. She makes it Randall. They're witty banter that they have with one. Another is one of my favorite Parts about this show and their lives that they interchange with one another. It's really really entertaining to me. I like to read she said, you know, you moved me to Philly. Let me live in Philly. Yes something you're uncomfortable with is something that makes me feel what is it? Like why can't where I'm from? Yeah. Yeah, that was really cute to see and just to see his fatherly instincts.",ant
9350," to interact because you can tell Beth kind of projected some of her fears that we're really more internal conflicts that she was having surrounding test, but she definitely is projecting onto test. So it's going to be an interesting relationship. I felt very bad though when she was saying, you know, I like when people tell us we look alike and like yeah, I'm not a bomb but the future mom and me was like, yeah that must be hard.

My prediction is I feel like this could be the beginning of the end for a Toby and Kate what this weight loss thing like him doing it behind her back. And so I feel like it's not going to be the end-all be-all. How many tissues do we have them all might be the start of the end. I don't know.

No, it was a little he said she said from high school for me in that situation. But here's my thing. We were against Beth whenever she was the one saying I need you to quit the race like I'm asking you and I'm telling you this is what I need you to do and stop I was all for Randall and I think now the cards have turned and it's the exact same scenario just later in the timeline for Beth.

I know fact that everybody trusted him enough. Here's my thing. Why would you take away all the trust that everyone gave you you were driving drunk with your niece just a while back. You just went into remission and you just got clean. It's only been a few months like people are giving you responsibility.",leech
9358," Parents numbers. He's the first person that volunteer to call them. I know like in the first couple of seasons and I thought it wasn't a fan of Miguel but now just kind of prospectively looking at it even Rebecca like she talks about Jack a lot lately and I can only imagine I get it like some people might say but Jack's not around sometimes that's even worse. Yeah, sometimes when you know that someone is not there for that person, you know that if it was up to them that's who they would be with and not you so it's like Rebecca starting about it. Yeah.",ant
9359," come to Kevin's offense and one more time just because I the way he spoke to Medicine was not appropriate. I don't agree. However, I get why he'll be annoyed by Madison not only because she's annoying but because in those moments fuse attention, she should really donuts and like trying to make conversation. Listen anybody that brings Donuts is my friend yet exactly and those family moments. You just want Family Guy recently had my grandma recently passed and we're in the hospital with her and felt friends become friends and even know she had and we were like, who are these people?",leech

Yeah, I didn't connect until the Facebook thing like years later. Yeah. He never once made a move on her right after Jack absolutely not so when I didn't like him till that point and when I saw that I go okay, I get it like some people cross your life for a reason you kind of have that history something they bond on. Hmm. Um, I think the kids would have a tough time no matter what I think it's obviously little bit worse. It's Miguel, but I mean, he still didn't take",bee
9361, Don't know I didn't like that. But I also think Toby has had the conversation with Jack he sat and talked to him and got to know him that I think that if you love someone that much and it's something you it's not even let it go. It's like you fall in love with the name to because they love it so much. I think Toby just hoping his baby makes it and it's not even being about the name. Yeah. He's like name them. Whatever you want is here. It's amazing. How strong Kate's being though. Mmm. I thought it would actually be the opposite where he would kind of be the mama bear.,leech

And then the other one was when we finally got to see baby Jack he's so tiny and anytime I just see preemies. I'm just like oh because there's such Fighters. They're so little and I just",ant
9363," So this is within the season guys like Sophie was still in season 3 like she wasn't gone in Season 2 Episode 15 a normal, right? Oh, this is like two seasons, correct. But what I'm saying is that she's been with him since they were in Middle School like even before then she's known him.

9364," Nobody ever thinks about the casting process. They just sort of assumed it just magically happen somehow. So I'm really grateful to you guys to want to talk about casting. So thank you. Yeah, and you had a little bit of magic for this particular episode which will talk a little bit more when we get to teenage Beth, but I know that there was a lot of a process going into finding our perfect Beth for a little bit. So chiming throughout the conversation because obviously you're a fan of the show as well.",bee
