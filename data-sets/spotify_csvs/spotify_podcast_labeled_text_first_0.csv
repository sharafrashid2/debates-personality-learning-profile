479," To end its In fairness. It is similar here except for the fact that it seems to be the main focal point of how you're going to advance the battle pass is by doing challenges, which it's one of those like Nick had a very before we started recording Nick had a very good analogy with the whole thing with the Battlefront 2 controversy a couple years ago when you discovered that I think it was actually Darth Vader, I think Darth Vader was one of the characters was that Peter and Luke Skywalker.",ant

And so that's when we kind of started dig into it right around the same time. All these articles started coming out about it was like what the heck? Yeah. And so here's the thing. This is for from all the sleuthing and digging and reading that that both of us have done. This seems to be the case. I've spoken with my buddy Anthony because he's been playing a lot about",bee

Go on vacation for one week. There goes seven of your easy levels and now you are finishing and week 12 have to work on the weekend unexpectedly, there goes another seven easy levels and now you better hope you have free time and week 13 to finish. Yeah and see my main problem with this isn't necessarily the challenges.",bee
482, Just gradual learning about a past levels for challenges. Like it should have been a comp. The challenges should be a compliment. They shouldn't be the strategy to rank up in the battle pass exactly and for an additive. They should be something on the side that you're doing as well right for me. It's almost a guarantee that weekly challenges aren't hard weekly challenges easy to do if you're playing the game. I'm averaging about two challenges a day when I'm playing.,bee
483," The game differently which again is fine. But like I don't I don't know again. We're not these kinds of players. We're not the like we're it's that with this in particular. It seems like it's more Destiny ask in the sense of making this a career game, which is totally fine. That's why I want you to be successful, but I Guardians all the dusty players are types of players that I cannot. I cannot stand beside me.",ant
484," Of course, they didn't have challenges so that you know that doesn't make sense for me to say but it also doesn't make sense. Why get rid of that system. Like I just it's just confusing, you know, and if someone please honestly like and don't be a dick about it, but if someone has like a good counter point to our conversation, let us know in this court. Let us know on Twitter because like I really want to hear someone else's opinion apart from our own because I feel like me and you're the only ones I mean",leech

I apologize for you similarly matched people and we maybe it was it helped just because the fact that we had a very community of person who was our third and he actually had a good strategy and we almost won that if we didn't get blindsided, so it was really yeah.

So we're going to go ahead and in the show right now jump back into the game have some fun. So what is your guy's opinion on the challenged based progression? Are you liking it? Are you hating it? Another thing about ranked is that you get more serious players because",ant

488, The heart and don't just because you heard that bit of information say these guys don't know what they're talking about. I'm out. Hopefully that's not the case. Hopefully you're still sticking around and if you are all so you're going to have a fantastic episode next week. We're going to go deep in to some of the content that we that we didn't get to touch last episode. Yeah. I'm really kind of take a better look at season 2 from from what we played so far. Yeah speaking of what we played so far. I do feel like I have a new lease on life after.,bee
489," There's something about it. I guess it's the TitanFall blood in it the TitanFall DNA but it just keeps bringing me back to it. Yeah, I have to agree with you. My focus is more on the team play aspect of it. I like the fact that and we'll get into it more when we really get die by diving deep into the unique features and everything, but I really do like the class setup. I like the fact that you're forced to",bee

Actually that really just wanted to play by myself and just kind of get that feeling of the gameplay in but you know, I couldn't so I just, you know, I ran through it I ran with more randos. Now the whole thing with the team conversation is very clear from the moment. You start the game now that's going to be what their class selection with which brings us to our first point of class-based characters. Yeah.",bee

They're both very traversal characters and some of their abilities and my third is going to be either.",ant
492," Peeing too and so it not only is a helpful tool for people who don't have any Mike's who can still play and still, you know, have a conversation in some ways on how to play the game. It also is a very beneficial tool for the actual gameplay itself, right? I feel like this on top of dropping together on top of having classes in general. This ping system is really the main driving force. It is trying to convey to you.",bee
493, Round and you are completely exposed not only that but then it takes a while for the Dropship to get there. So either you just leave your friend to die or you stick around because the catch there is that you really are respawning in the sense that you have to scavenge again. You have to get armor again and everything. So it's definitely you are coming in new but it's it's really cool.

It was to meet a deadline but being under like constant crunch after a game has been out for a while. And literally all you have to do is here's a new skin.

Yeah, and I think that is the biggest that if that's the biggest takeaway other than thank God they actually treat their workers, right if that's the biggest takeaway. I think that's you know, I just hope they actually I hope they stick to it, you know, because saying you're going to be more communicative and actually being communicative is obviously going to be two separate things and we need to see that they care we need to see that it's going to make it's going to matter so",bee

1144," I was freelancing, you know that stuff set up pocket and it just wasn't you know, it's really just like four practices in a row and it opened scrimmage. So in terms of budgeting for the season that hadn't been worthwhile, but it was cool to get to do you know the access? Like I said, it's just it really just felt like for practice days in a row and then the open scrimmage so nothing crazy there, but it was cool man. It was cool though. Like, you know all these practices every coach and every front office members around and a lot of time to like",bee
1145," Secular group Kyrie, obviously being the main guy there to try and figure that out. But that was an example of just where it didn't end up working in some guys had to go separate ways and all that stuff. Whereas, you know in this situation that that's the goal clearly is is to make that to make that work so that that sort of situation doesn't happen with the Raptors and I think that's a really difficult thing to do as a coach, but I think the Raptors are done pretty good job so far and nurse obviously pushes that even in just his like offensive system sort of idealism.",ant
1146," you know, that's that's something that those guys are going to have to take up and that's why you know in one of those spots at least I kind of leaned toward someone who has a history of being able to get their own shot and willingly feeling a bit of a usage void. Yeah, which makes sense. I think Gasol and particular. I think a lot of people are looking towards him to take at with a usage rate increase just doing I guess running more of the offense as more of a hub than he was last season.",bee
1147," You like another to guard option better for that slot. As long as North three-point shot is in the high 30s. I think he's going to fit fine. He's one of the the guys who's better. He's more capable of attacking a closeout and making things happen from the corner. Not a good enough playmaker yet to wear. You know, this this free-flowing everyone touches the ball offense maybe doesn't suit him as well as it suits some other guys, but he can attack a closeout and make place for himself. And I think there's going to be a need for",ant
1148," it makes a little more sense for Vamp lead to come off the bench come in and play some of those playing some of those two guard lineups close with some of those two guard lineups, but things are probably going to be a little better balance with Van Vliet Off the Bench running that second unit giving some some much-needed shooting to that second unit. And then you know, I think his minutes should be up around 30 this year both because he's one of the best players on the team and because the Raptors need to see what he can do in that kind of role, but I think I think the rotations probably just going to flow better.",bee
1149," Yeah, and so, okay so quickly the other two guys at that spot very unlikely, but hey their names are in there and they're interesting. Everybody is aboard the Terrence Davis hype train and he's shown out amongst The Fringe guys. He's been fun to watch and that fourth quarter in the first game was really exciting and that the donkey had over Jaron blossomgame who fun fact when I was covering and I don't five game or this past season and was writing a gamer Jaron blossomgame entirely shifted.",ant
1150," line up. So just kind of relegated to the word for word here and obviously Kauai was their last season defensive rebounding is we're going to replace more than anything. I thought Kauai was a fantastic rebounder for the team last season. I thought we did a lot of the heavy lifting in that department that nobody really talk that much about it was the best I've ever seen him with that aspect of his game. I mean, he was a good rebounder of San Antonio, but he didn't have to do it there like he did with Toronto with a lot of the small lineups and you know Ibaka depending on how locked in he has he can be an up-and-down rebounder and Gasol.",ant
1151," Three front core positions you'd be fine. But yeah, it's raining Ibaka there would certainly be a way to Goose that and keep you know, keep a Baca in a role where he's getting some starts and getting more minutes and the about could sell pairing worked pretty well in small samples last year. Yeah. I mean the Raptors are obviously really high on OG they've been hyping him up all preseason and obviously Mass has kept them out of trade talks any of the important ones and so they're clearly",ant

1153," Yes and having having a voice that is distinct you is good. But I also don't think you want to like walk into it because you're going to change and your approach is going to change and yeah, like you said like it's something that it can always be better and you should always wanted to be better. So yeah, I know you're a big reader outside of the sports world as well and which I find interesting and think that everybody should be I think if you're no matter what industry you're in I think you should always be reading outside of it because it kind of keeps you fresh keeps your mind on other things.",bee

I was terrified of hitting the publish button almost any time I wrote anything. I think a lot of writers deal with it and have it and it's something that tends to stick with people for most of their lives. If you're a writer, you're always going to be a writer and impostor syndrome. That is something that I was just kind of there and I'm just curious like how do you handle that when it comes to your writing and is there may be a healthy",ant

Not that I'm not happy to do this one, but I don't like I don't like hosting a bug cast I'd much rather just right and that's like, you know, I don't I don't really journal or anything like that but like when I've dealt with",bee

I'm gonna ask you to add another question name to Preston players to press the deployers and Billy Bodine and Josh harrop.",ant
1172," Watson came through the ranks. Yeah, and and we we had Andy Wilco he was 2627 the same the same, you know age as Tommy Smith and he got displaced from the team. This is when Ryan shot and was you know, 18 19, so he's still a teenager and obviously didn't quite turn out how we'd like it to but yeah, he he",ant

Yeah, well same standard but we've gone from beating City United it set you up, you know the same place but are now losing 3-1 to Charles and you know, it's mad. Yeah, it's magic. That's all I can say even for me and the age difference between you and me. We still have the same opinion. Yes, we can't believe",ant

You know, why do you knows? Nobody knows where the money to stoke whole body knows who it is of the coats family that actually says",bee
1175, On each Wing So it isn't Tom Edwards running all the way to Born working. He sucks off crostini and then all of a sudden the ball comes back and he's 90 yards out of position.

Well, we really appreciate it man. So we scrapped our plans, you know, we've been just reach out to you a bit weak at talk to you before the draft. And as we said last time our schedules are crazy busy, but you made your a nice talk to make some time. So we want to get you after the draft talk a little bit about that and just you know bounce.",bee
1178," As in better situations Will Harris was a draft pick for the future much like Tracy Walker was last year where it's probably going to be spot play and then he'll he'll develop into a starting role and you can kind of see that with some of the day three guys to there there. There's potential for them to contribute on a lower level early, but you can see opportunities for them open up on the roster long-term. Nice now grifter. I know you're over there and I know I'm supposed to pass it to you, but I got one.",bee
1179," Beeping would be there but didn't expect to be there and so close. Yeah, but but Hawkinson again at I mean Hawkinson was right up there with him and that at that same level of caliber. Here's a gift. I thought you guys last time about what a big bad Oliver fan. I was beaten. I was told that they weren't as high on him. And I think that's it's obvious that they weren't as high on him the fact that they took Hawkinson over him what I was a bit.",ant
1180, I feel like if they stick with what they did last week with the shifting around of guys if that's the same shifting or if that's the same spots that are in this week. Then we might as well just write that in on the depth chart because that's probably what's going to be all the way into training camp. The next one will be excuse me. What is the the the safety situation? How is that shaking out? I want to know who I have an idea in my head.,bee
1181," Double-teaming thinking they're going to go to Hawkinson or some of the other poem wide receivers lines have that might open up a spot for NADA to catch them catch them TD's it's possible. I mean, he's only six three and a quarter so he doesn't create like a huge Target but he's so reliable, you know, he doesn't drop watch it. Also, that's right. I mean he caught 86% in the past has thrown his way right and he only dropped like",ant
1182," Athletic standpoint, he was a full quid qualifier at safety, but he was also a full quote qualifier at cornerback. So he's very athletic and what they look for in a defensive back in general and they can use them all in a lot of different ways. And I think he's their future joke. I think he's they're hoping he turns into Patrick Chung. So right now Tavon Wilson is in that is going to be in that role the were he's the third safety Off the Bench and I think Harris is going to challenge for that and it's very possible that he comes in and he ends up being that",ant
1183," No, one-on-one. Personally, I guess what's it like, you know, is that are they easy to talk to are they willing to come up and just kind of chat with you when you're there can they be a little difficult? I mean you don't have to name any names or anything like that, but what's it really like to be able to do that? You know some guys like me kind of want to know that because like I said, I want to go to training camp. I just maybe get a one-on-one when they sign an autograph or really don't get a chance to talk to him. Well, I tell you what, what what's unique about the Lions and what they've done with giving me an opportunity and giving the guys.",bee
1184," With with the media, sometimes he likes them and sometimes he doesn't and so I mean with with Asia and he's a he's an interesting somebody like you just have to gauge where he's at. Right and that's true. That's going to be true of most guys. Like when you go in the locker room after a loss you have to be able to gauge who's ready to talk and who isn't because every I bought every after every game I talked to Deshawn him.",ant
1185," For like your holidays and your Marvin Jones, I think that gives them opportunities and I don't know how well that speaks for Amendola. I think Jesse James and Hawkinson will kind of eat off of each other Carrie and Johnson should be in a good situation being this the clear starter, but I do think that you know last year he averaged like 11 touches a game. I think that could get the 15 but he's not going to be too getting like 25 like some of your other every day.",ant
1186, Won't be jaw-dropping numbers. It'll be he'll be making key plays at critical times. And I think that's what their goal for him is is to be a guy that they can use to keep the drive going or take the next step in what they want to do on offense. I wanted to hit the Bell so many times while you put out all these fires that gryska has I love T Johansen and natural mover. He's going to be able to hold his own on the edge. Whereas me Braun and a bunch of,ant
1187," Absolutely, man. I just felt like we had to do a little therapy here at the end for Griff because I've been working on them and I think once he sees this player he's gonna love how it catches the football how we blocks how he's a team player, you know those touchdowns when we need them first downs, we need them all that type of stuff so we could talk for days Eric me and you could just talk football. They long I absolutely love it, you know, and then there's gryska but no, we love having you on the show. Go ahead. You know before I talk all about all the great stuff.",bee

It couldn't be easier. Anchor",ant
1189," Oh, man, I don't know if it's going to be a re-run of our last show. But again makes me laugh super funny. You know, I think I did catch wind of these as well. And I really just shook my head because I mean if any of the off Seasons the last handful of years have been pretty Dynamite for the lion suspend this one in regards to only who we got what we spent, you know, how productive we were proactive right off the get-go of free agency, you know,",ant
1190, Seems crazy to me in a brutal sport like football.,ant
1191," It out and there's these kids and people everywhere. Like I don't know like t-shirt vendor men like, you know, we don't got to be PG everywhere, but I don't know that you got to be dropping a triple F bomb about the Packers or whatever. It is on a t-shirt like a foot away from Ford feel while we're exiting the game. I mean, are you with me on this group? Yeah. I always thought that was almost like classless for the lack of a better term, but I know some people are like, yeah awesome manually because it always seems like there's a horde of people around them to I just don't know if it's",ant
1192," Okay, so let's move on here. There's a couple things I saw this week. I want to touch base with you on was that Rod would he did an interview this this weekend? It was brought up on Martha Ford has a lot less tolerance for mediocrity and her husband did now instantaneously when that's brought up all the Talking Heads were just like, oh my gosh, if they don't make the playoffs this year, that means that means Matt Pat's gone, you know, that means they're going to make some",ant
1193," My next question for you digs, he was doing an interview this week and he said he was ready to be the leader in the defensive backfield. My question to you is I mean things have been around for a few years now and do you believe the defensive backs that are on this team, you know would be willing to have digs as their leader and maybe even guys on the defense, you know, look towards him, you know, let him be the leader. And also do you think he could be a good leader?",bee
1194," Oh, man. Yeah, let's take a road trip buddy. I've been saying that all four seasons and I've City I've been there before. Yeah, absolutely. But yeah, I don't know that we should road trip for a practice and you know how riveting those can be when we stand out in the 80 degree heat Allan Park and see nothing and then sit there and go like what did we come here for you? But I think the joint practices are great, man, when it comes to get your teeth football team better practice against other people as well as",ant
1195, that being said Griff gotta,ant
1196," Yeah, I mean, yeah, I don't know where the where the fans podcast were fans. Yes, we take pride in being two guys that love football that come on here Yak. Laugh it up do whatever we do each week and have a bunch of fun. Secondly. We're not Amateur hour because everybody that listen Detroit cool a cast knows we got the greatest intro music in the business. I mean, am I right grip because the three versions of the Detroit Kool-Aid cast intro is straight up straight fire and has been from since day one. I mean am I wrong hell? Yeah.",ant
1197, Drink it in.,ant
1198," I know you've talked about it on your show, but I'm just interested. If you could give us kind of a quick summary about your quiz score. You really been diving into that and it's really interesting that you've developed this on like custom score / analytical system that you kind of use to judge who Bob Quinn's looking at with lions might be interested in so tell us a little bit about how you developed it and exactly what it is and kind of a short form that yeah. So basically how it works is when Bob Kane was",ant
1199," Two players fit. Athletically we have to also incorporate. Okay, these guys don't fit schematically and then we know we can kind of move on from them. So quip is just the athletic part of it. There's there's still a film story film study portion of it that also helps us but that's not technically the quit that's just part of our overall scouting process. Okay, very cool. Like I want to get that out right off the top. I know a lot you've talked about it and you've written some awesome articles, but I wanted to",ant
1200," It does make sense because you can pick up another day to pick your only dropping around what six spots and then it still gives you some leverage if to move back again, if you if you wanted to really the the depth of this class is the as on Day 2 in my opinion and where their their needs meet the depth. There's so many like nice fits there on day two tight end Corner guard wide receivers.",ant
1201, Gary is a he's somewhat repetitive for the Lions. I don't know how his path to the field would be that is as smooth as a guy like Burns or sweat but sweat has some off-the-field issues from his time at Michigan State. I know from my Michigan State contacts that the stuff that he was he ran with the really bad crowd and he ran with the crowd where a couple years ago. There was a player out of Michigan state that the Lions weren't going to touch,ant
1202, At the Senior Bowl and they met with them at the combine. So they're very interested in him. It's just a matter of are they willing to overlook some of those character flaws because from a from a measurement standpoint he fits everything that they want. I mean his arms are insane. They love arm length. They love guys that go to the Senior Bowl. They love fast kind of these these fat fast guys that can be both fast and quick. He's got it he's got all of it. And so I just don't know.,ant
1203," I mean, I feel like I love that we did in free agency. I love you know, kind of how they're making this defense go from somewhat porous defense early last year to a pretty dominant unit towards the end of the year with snacks and whatnot in regards to opposite a sleigh. I mean, I know we brought in players. Do you think they'll address that in the drafter can excuse me? Can we get a player that can really be not necessarily a lockdown guy but a guy that's substantially better than what we've had.",ant
1204," well UMass is pretty small school. So Andy Isabella makes a lot of sense, but I think you're probably looking for like a name. That's a little bit smaller than him his since his name's out there. So let's say q and dose out of UC Davis. There's a small school guy. He is a big slot / vertical guy got injured in the in the bench, press at the combine. So we didn't get a chance to go but he is a guy who",ant
1205," One of the people in that pool and they think that he can add, you know get after the quarterback. I think he's somebody that we have to consider especially if he's bulking up a little bit that's it, you know intriguing and nice to see you as well. So I'll go ahead and kick it back to her school. Thanks for breaking out Burns a little bit there with the signings lines of already made and I realized there's still a few names out there in free agency. Do you feel there's anybody out there that the lines may be targeting right now?",bee
1206, The running back we got to get this.,ant
1207, An average NFL back up. He's the fun story and he's a great person. But if carry on gets hurt in let's say CJ Anderson shows a little bit of blunt 2.0. Are you comfortable was accent or being your starting running back? And I don't think that they are Beyond maybe the one game he was last season. So I do think that they're looking to add a running back that they can develop and possibly take over because,ant
1208," Many things up a little bit more and now with with that vertical attacking game, it plays batter into Stafford's approach. It goes back to you know, a few years ago even pre Jim by computer when he was very successful with Linehan and stuff. So, you know, I think I think that we could we could see a change in the approach and I think Stafford should benefit from that that change in that offensive attack.",ant

We haven't seen a losing streak like this and a long time when the Lions were bad, you know, he moves a few win one. There's a few more when one this is just been you know, since since basically around that Oakland game, you know got 2-1 win against the Giants.

We don't care about Denver and Detroit just get it over with so we make sure that we can get to either what was it Dallas and Philly next or whatever other game they had on for thought. That was so much more important when these guys are getting dollars trying to add to his 1100 some yards and who knows what would have happened on that drive for?,leech

1224," Gonna blow you off the page with his overall, you know athleticism maybe how they use him on certain games.

I'm like that's bacome a field right now.",ant
1228," All sites for the game. Yeah. I have a question for you. I know a lot of coaches. They usually breakdown seasons in quarters, you know, you know every four games and they try to win every quarter.

Do you think the first quarter of this?",ant

Yeah, you know, you have a chance to take somebody who at one point in the draft process was projected to be, you know, a top 10 top 15 pick and he's still sitting there at 43. I mean unbelievable cover skills, you know, if anybody can get anybody to start making tackles and start playing More Physical it's probably matpat.

He said he was talking about what he wanted or what to do in the next situation.

Hey quarterback, you know, we're having this fun like back and forth, which was cool. And and as I'm doing that I'm thinking in my mind. All right, like shake it this football sign with a black Sharpie or not. So and as I look off to my left of the corner of my eye, I see Matt Stafford like in the middle of the two fields and he looks like he may come over which again is like seeing a lunar eclipse because it never happens.

So you get Frank in there and find two guards that can plug holes and move forward with your offensive line for the long term, but I don't know very very interesting the way those five pieces always come together.

1259," Team, so I think they're very much improved. I think we still have no idea what Trey flowers can and will be for this team just because we really have not brought in a free agent like him.

We're gonna have ferocious defense and with Matt Stafford having a bounce back like I could see us being top 12 in the league in points and offense as well.,ant
1261," I think he is not going to be fun to watch to see what we have. But you know, what is this ceiling will be kind of crucial to where he plays and how much so well, I like that. My point is with that. I mean if they're going to if they announce them as a linebacker, that's he would have to play that position that Canard plays he's not going to play the he's not a weak side linebacker. He's not fast enough to be the weak side linebacker. So that that would be my point if that's where they're going to play my linebacker. Well, I agree but I'm saying that the a day now.",ant

Yep, give other teams fits and then your third lines Backlund.",ant

I remember watching it and being like,",ant

Everybody's standing still there's zero speed. We're not breaking out of her and with speed anymore. So they either tip it in at the blue line or they get,ant

We are that's like literally the only place we shot from and we were talking to that guy on Twitter and he was saying how like remember last year like they would just shoot from right inside the slot. Yeah compared to this year.,ant

1359," That would be so much more effective and half the price. Well do Cheech but like imagine that'd be way more effective. Get out of here Mark Jankowski the the fact and this goes in the whole management thing again. The fact that this guy is still on this team. Well, it speaks to two things did Brad she living learn nothing from the Joel Colburn experience? Why didn't he trade this guy?",ant
1360," Perfect. Not perfect still missing two ty6 forwards from that group. And that's the thing this buys you time until you bring another guy and then you look at another options, but I don't see how any other iterations going. Well and again, like I don't see how that the lack of willingness to try something else right now when we're literally scoring two goals per 60 Minutes one of the worst in the league.",ant

1362, What do you have you got dick nothing?,ant
1363, Probably sought after from other teams that you could get something for right now. I'm fine with Backlund and and probably the number one reason is because of the same. Number one reason I was okay with fairly getting moved is that in the past two or three seasons outside of being really hot on the 3M line at times?,ant

They have way more goals than we do for a team. They can't score.

Yep. I mean probably their best not their best game of the season, but I mean best three periods probably because it's not the Oilers kind of pressed a little bit in the second, but for the most part the Flames didn't dominate but they were definitely a better team through most of the first through most of the third and through probably the latter half of the second. So I mean lost all the craziness life.",ant

And then if he is not scoring, we don't really have much else.",ant

1409, To it's like I don't know. Well it all came out of the air France's thing. It's like one of the narratives I've seen kind of on Twitter lately is like why don't we trade Johnny gaudreau? This team can't win with Johnny gaudreau. It's just like it's mind-boggling to me and imagine how that affects you your like. I am the best player this team has had in 20 years and I'm the problem.

Right and we saw spurts of Johnny being Johnny. He was good last night's game winner. Yeah, he set up the set up the Monahan goal like what you see like you said to me earlier is like as soon as you got that Puck and kind of cross from the blue and Yoko shit. Something's gonna happen here. I had a good feeling. Yeah, you can tell when he's got that he was good last night. Sean Monahan was a beast last night. So please keep that up.

So you just tow drag one of the top players in the in the leak and it okay. Here's another thing that I was like thank God Jeff Ward. Thank God Bill Peters is gone.

He'll fucking no so good on Jeff for putting him out there because he had a really good game and you put them out there.",bee

I was thinking about this last night because they talked about it a little bit and I was like not to toot our own horn here, but it's just like no fucking tutor way. We've been calling this shit for a while. We were talking about how like, okay if you could ever have a line a great solid possession line that can play all the tough minutes and we were suggesting the exact line that is now the quote-unquote first line Lindholm module suggest Rock.",ant

The Jankowski penalty was bullshit. Yeah, that was fucking dump that was and if you know if Mark can cause he's fired up something's wrong. So anyways, I think is in the first minute.",ant
1420," One you arguably you could say their performance is one you the game. Well, I do you also had secondary scoring contributions as well. It was like it was a great team win. Yeah, so when those guys are playing like they played last night Riddick solid you're playing pretty well defensively because again like we did give up more High danger chances. Yep, but in give up too much and break was good when you did give them up.",ant

1422," Shit that has happened. This season can be put completely behind you. This can completely start over and that's the thing. These guys are in a seven-game winning streak. I think part of the narratives like hey, let's see how long let's see how many we can win. I mean, what's it been three straight Seasons? They've won 10 in a row. Yeah. Did they win ten in a row last year? They definitely your previous they did. I think the dead think they might I don't know if they got quite stand but they were definitely on like some sort of ten point did it here?

I think they came down at the Post Yeah, and then now you're a tall man. So Sam Bennett, like boy that game was gold medal. It's a nasty. It was all sorts of nasty, but he stood out like a like a sore thumb. I think stood out as a not good player for me last I think in all fairness. He should get another shot when the team's actually playing.",ant
1425," Anyways, that's a little besides the point but you shouldn't even on the ice, but man I'm really annoyed with him and it's again, he's our fourth line Center. So I mean like it's kind of silly for us to be like shitting all over like get described as you see he's the problem. He's not the problem. He's just it's annoying to watch and play. Yeah. No, it's true. So yeah anyways, okay, let's get into some positives first. Well, no, you don't want to talk about that gold Rick let in. Oh, yeah cool. The second goal is bad. That's officially the worst glove ever seen him let it in.",ant
1426," On your power plays a defenseman. It makes zero sense to then the for group is weird. Like even when it was background music Ryan, I don't really think Darren does much. They're like, I hope ones aren't comes back. I hope ideally for me power plants you would be again if they're so goddamn held an opening music there. That's okay with me. I'd go Lou Cheech zonic mangiapane. I don't mind Ryan maybe Ryan and then Anderson. Yeah. I just the deployment is so weird with that.",ant
1427," Wade I think we touched on already but I'm not sold or convinced that Lou Cheech is having much of an impact on this team yet. It seems to be very minimal and it's like again like watching him is kind of like banging your head against the wall for some reason for me. It's just like it's almost like a buzzkill. Yeah it totally it's everyone and it's weird because in the dome it's like everyone kind of gets excited when he gets the puck. It's weird. It's like a really good. That's like what we even kind of semi finishes a hit. Yeah, but he literally did.",ant
1428," I just don't see us competing on a on a bigger scale that we did last year in the playoffs. If he's on the third line and you're counting on him to be in the third wave know exactly like 100% and maybe not even the fourth line. I mean, we'll see how it plays out. Yeah. We'll see how it plays. No, that's a that's like to me.",ant
1429," Like nobody knows who's what and it's and it's not translating on to anything on the ice like nothing. So at least 0 and I don't know if that comes down to is just an identity thing where it's like now guys don't know what their role is and I guess that'll get smooth out throughout the season. But to me, that's the most concerning thing for me. Is that because you don't know how long it'll take to click. Yeah. You don't know how I'm not gelling to take now best-case scenario is a couple",ant
1430," Basically, they only have one day off in between every single game. Yeah, that's the entire month till they have a month till the plagues. All right. So road trip going up three-game road trip. Dallas is not looking good at all thus far so I mean, they're gonna they're gonna be hungry for a win. I don't know and I mean we never fucking win in Dallas. It's why did the Flames never win in places? It's like I'm pretty sure they haven't won in Vegas yet. No. Well, no one's what I mean. It's like every every weird stabbers like, oh the who's the team that hasn't won in fucking Timbuktu over.",ant
1431," I'm right. So we tied the season series last year. Yeah, I kind of forgot about it. And then they kind of kicked our ass do you have or that years has been caused in the we are they always beat us. So that's why I'm kind of little surprised especially given the yo-yo team. We've seen all year. That's why you and I are always kind of a bit worried going to the battle Alberta. It's like, please don't lay a fucking goose egg against the Oilers. Well, I'm always worried about it because like, you know, you're gonna hear it from Oilers fans regardless of the outcome. They",ant
1432," I I did not expect him to join the circle. Jerk dude, like okay. It was more exacerbated with the McDavid Giordano thing. I don't even know how this thing that broadcast my God and again like it's unbearable. Like it's kind of funny when you hear it. Like you hear clips of Kevin Quinn losing his mind with gave it. It's like, oh he's such a homer and stuff. But when you actually have to sit there and watch and listen to a whole game of that shit. It's on.",leech

I think we even talked about that last year you and I yeah, and we said fuck are you he's in the top five with McDavid totally and I stand on some nights. I'll take Johnny over McDavid totally with how much he could create last year was how dominant and how how he could take over a game with his skill last year.",ant
1435," I think so. You got to a place where they know we just need the win. Yes. He probably just got chewed up by the coach. Well, obviously, but for me, the biggest thing was what's Chucky going to do next next and we've been talking about this is like, he's the type of guy that he's a fucking anomaly and do you have to go back and look at how he held the whole Drew Doughty situation when he elbowed you doubting in the head with pretty dirty Play We may add because this is immediately probably yeah like",ant
1436, He said the more I heard people say you don't have to fight him. You shouldn't fight him the more I will kind of wanted to do it. Yes. I love having this guy in our team is love this guy. And that's Matthew could chuck. That's what we love them.,bee
1437," Was reader because like he's useless the oh, I know the only reason why reader is in that lineup last night is because he played for a Million last year. Well, that's just so dumb and then like, how do you think that like jncos he's had enough issues this season guy plays a pretty good game against the blue scores a goal and then he scratched like, I don't think that's a good way to you know, get Marc Janko ski going again. Oh, yeah, you scored in back-to-back games finally. Well, that's that's scratchy. That's what words been doing for the last two months. Remember when Ronaldo scored like goal.",ant
1438," But it's just like it's starting to get worried some of the Jeff warlike men. And yeah, I just uh, I just wanted to get true because it's the same thing we experienced last year when we were winning Bill peers even said it himself. Listen, the amount of goals were scoring as masking a lot of our issues. We're winning games. Listen. What do we have? We're leading the league in one goal wins. Are we not?

Anyway, that's the other thing. I like about last night is when you can roll Monaghan Lindholm Backlund Ryan that help like and I know Derek Ryan is played very well this season but when you can roll him on your fourth line, yeah, that is a huge Advantage for your team.

It's very true explain that explain how that works this. Well the score fact, it's it's kind of a I think most people kind of know it intuitively it takes into account that I have a gate at the team is behind ya and pressing for a goal that there's going to be a differential you're going to be not as obviously you're gonna be on your heels a little more so it kind of adjust for that.",ant
1447," he was now as a whole in the year. What is he 917? I think he's 9:23. I had to pulled up here 9:23 on the year 1923. So his record as it stands currently 15 games played six wins 7 losses 923 say percentage two, five one goals against and us pretty excellent goal saved above average. So at six point six nine quite good. Okay compared to Riddick Reddick has played Jesus. He's played a lot of hockey man. He's played 33 games. He's got eight.",ant

Yeah, and I think well, there's kind of a weird. There's a false argument going on right now. I think it's mostly perpetuated by dumbass Eric Francis who's like stop looking to steal the job. It's like that's not the question for me is it it's not even a question. It's like no really need some rest and Talbots playing. Well, right Talbot for a bit.

Well, it feels Bill Peters tell but when you got the last two starts so exactly the fact that tell what dig at the last two starts, I would think he's getting the next one too. So I'd be very surprised if it was David Wright again, and I don't even know if I'm not thinking to be upset. I just think he still needs more.

So that's why you're seeing all those dimensions of say you have to be several feet above the top of the boiler and then you have got to go through turns and you have to go into pipes of a certain size that will slow the velocity of the scheme so that the water that does get pulled out of the Border will go back into the boiler before it has a chance to get out into the building you're creating your resistance.

They'll beat the likes of Norwich and Waterford kind of a tall man. They'll get they'll be safe there. There was no doubt in might slip into the bottom half of the table.",bee

I think I think Duncan Ferguson could have irreparably damaged his confidence at that club. Like he was Italian and fragile or anyway, he'd be had the bollocks abused off him in Uva before he left. Yeah. It was really tease a kid like he's only night. I think he's only 19. Yeah and the shit that he to dealers in Italy before he came to England and then he comes to Liverpool. He must feel like he moved to Mary's life.",bee

They've it's so out of character from what we know from Shonda Asia and that Burnley team. They're usually diagraph. Yeah. I do usually very hard to be like there's a lot of games the waste they haven't been heard to be the way song scored that goal against him a few weeks ago. He really literally Randall indeed. It would have been tackled and that seems to be their approach to every game at the moment. I don't know.",ant

He was mentioned for the Everton at Arsenal jobs. They haven't won a game they buried it. I think they will mourn game since yeah, I think that was their chance he game. That's the first game dest. I think Dan start from there only winning nine or something like that. Exactly and it's literally from the day. He was touted for those jobs. That's what it all started going out now, maybe",bee

It will be a moral victory for all the n in his side hole in the league leaders to draw and that might kick start a bit of a change in fortunes for him. But yeah, I got a little and hopefully I'm wrong. I never think in these games between United Liverpool that it's very very rare that you'll get a high-scoring game. Yeah. It has seen a few in history, but it's very rare that it happens and no matter how poor you know, it is former is at the moment. They're still going to frost.",ant
2518, The 2018 2019 season is now gone. It has been that that has been lifted. Like they've lost two of their last four games. We might have said the Norwich game was a bit of a blip but it ain't and it shows again against wolves. So I see as you said Palace have been the surprise package this year. We all thought last year start to terribly Roy Hodgson do the miracle to end up where they were. I know he's looked at our Squad this year and our to have nothing like they don't really have anything there better.,ant

It seems in the last few games and they'll be looking to make it three wins in a row in this game. Absolutely. I did a spelled their weird home record of not having a winning the Premier League at home and they've for a while and if they've won the last two and I would home director in great form the score and plenty of goals that are back for has solidified somewhat and go low can't they?,ant
2521," That like that says that I will take yeah true. They take it end up there can it up second. Theoretically if I live Palace Speed City, they couldn't up second. What a weekend. That would be. Yeah, so I'm yeah, so let me Chelsea win. I I just I just don't see anything else really to be honest. I like a funny feeling New Paths were gonna frustrate you had seen this kid. Yeah. I do not like I think I wouldn't get too excited about Newcastle beat man, you know, because I didn't know I'm not excited Leyton Orient would have beaten man.",ant

Yeah, but I'm they just have to be careful for that. But otherwise, I just I see accidents going to betray him when in Fairly handily. What is the story with measure those? Oh, I don't know. I actually forgot even play for Arsenal to be honest. I Emery just does not fancy him at all now. I will he's lazy like we've known that for years maybe he just isn't having any of that anymore.

Like he's not that highly rated and ever he wasn't even in their squad until a game. So that'll tell you where he is. Yeah. I like the art Squad isn't as everyone knows is no great shakes now he's young. So we'll see but they don't bring just don't have much they don't like to their real scraping the barrel Squad boys and Phil I can't,bee

Is it be he won't play again in 2019, but he will play again early in the new year. But that remains to be seen. I don't think to be honest that Hugo Lloris has an excellent keeper. We all know that but I don't think he's a massive last as far as I think as Antigua is a good isn't it reasonable enough Deputy, but still I know Larry's can make howlers, we've seen that but he still there's still a club Captain as well.

They can play lovely football and he can counter well, but usually it's just being absolutely see are like being the lame their goal has been laid Siege to for 85 minutes. So that's what her that's where the kind of dangerous too.",ant

Yeah, that's going to make it even more. There's going to be more of a bike there and obviously is not the last week were very lucky to get three points against Villa going a man down and going to one down and ended up aubameyang saving them.

No and if it is him leading the line, maybe we sin Socrates might have that glorious clean sheet that are so unique because they've conceded Tangles so far this season, but maybe this",ant

But yeah, I think Spurs have had a good few seasons particularly last season get the Champions League final finishing the other Fort actually in the Premier League last season, but distilled in first purse they've had good seasons and you have to look at it from pocha.

So In fairness to party no afterwards. He said it's the rules of the game. There's nothing we can do about it. Sometimes it benefits those some signs that benefits others, which he was basically saying we got the benefit of a before I'm not going to be on about it now and that's fair enough and it is offside offside. He was outside. That's the rules of the game. Yeah.",ant

Please make a prediction from a guy for the game. Well, I think if spores win, they'll win the game. What of Southampton win they'll be the winners. Yeah. That was that was a terrible prediction to be honest. I'm gonna I'm gonna go again with that. I'm going to say Spurs will win the game was until maybe to knit Bush. I'm going to put it in again.

So that's probably why they had to do was to be fair. They know that they can sit back is not a type of football. I play what if you look at Wofford right a wife or went out with it's a just say we'll put it into place here for as an example watchword said we won't express ourselves not as expressed and organs expecting anything of us were bottom of the table. We have a goal and then you get your whole up and don't know like I'll push what what what what,ant

They're pumping money into this club for absolutely is absolutely and I said, they're cutting the cameramen are obviously aware of what's going on and they're cutting to the to the lads are in the standard the owners and they do not called happy figures. They know they're like clouds that are fed up to the teeth of what I've seen on the field and like, you know, the Fall Guy is always going to be the manager and I think silver while he is a good manager. We saw that yeah, we saw it.",ant
2537," The second half no doubt myself. I think this is this is the ideal fixture for Liverpool after the week. They just had it had a rough week. They went to Napoli played. Well last two nil. Yeah, and then they went to Chelsea fair enough. They won't but they weren't the better. So he was like, I didn't want hired it won't ugly and there's a lot of you know people come out there was a lot of press after the game about how they want ugly blah blah blah, which is fair enough. They won the game. They got three points.",ant
2538," Napoli game it was then he rolls into Chelsey like so he looked hard at the end of that chasing and he was arrested at that new custom game because he just come back from playing to a church in South America, you know, so that's there's a lot of Liverpool players who've been all over the world in the last few weeks. And there's the likes of Salah and money who've been playing African Cup football all summer. So I just think we break is coming at a good time. Yeah. It'll never Philbin not a great. Hope for Sheffield United. I agree and I think that have 12 fixture you get a chance to set your start out.",ant
2539," Liverpool need a clean sheet the only one now and this season which is which is it's not great for Liverpool inaudible conceded five goals, but still five goals in six games isn't on reload are like what I like. Yeah. I clean a clean sheet is widely completely and cheats now it says what live what I want and especially when Alison out they want to be a solidity at the back there again. Yeah, and this might be a good one to try and got to go and get it like us goals aren't exactly forthcoming for Sheffield, you know, exactly happening in a Min left right and Center you have they're not going to make",ant

Yeah. I did watch out it does and I think that's the second or third at 90 minute plus equalizer. Not only that wolves played with 10 men for a large large the yeah and it Palace were wounded ahead of 10 men and if I'm not",ant

This is Villa if they stay up is going to be done at home this where they're going to get their points and then total Ming's has his work cut out from against the two boys. Yeah, what some parents I that's a tough test for anybody and I think means probably no offense to Villa or any other fans would means carries that defense. All he does is just going to say he can't he can't keep that show go on his own. Yeah.",ant

This is a game a neutral watching all these two could ever like clip off each other here because they really already during a serious battle for their lives like exactly so like I do it slightly favored ones and I will tip will wolves to win Bush.

I think they're conceding goals thing is it will signs are they artists or not going to be as open season as it as it was at Staten Island.

2551," No, it's it's just it's there like a team that is just living under nerves or something. That's when I just can't get my head around it. This is perplexing me to be honest. Yeah, I don't understand it at all. It seems at the moment that the Merry-Go-Round of managers that's been around for the past two or three seasons is empty at the moment. Mmm, like the managers that float around that have been floating around like ancelotti Pellegrini Conte, you know Mourinho stelae Mourinho.",ant

So worried about that game spores again another team that needed a serious turn in form and that's and liberals next game. Never an easy game party. No knows how to play against Liverpool. It's been a tough game for the last few years. I think we've drawn most of them. Yeah, I mean one or two wins either side, they'll feel like they all everyone after the Champions League finals while they played most good for Paula.",ant
2554," When they get a bit more of a settled starting eleven, yeah, they can start obliterating teams and they will and it's going to be close like you can nearly put your house on the fact that at the end of next month when Liverpool are played Manchester City that Laporte Johnstone's and Kevin De bruyne. It will all be fit to start packing. Yeah 100% I completely agree dealt. Then you can guarantee that that that game is a Target in Guardian was mined for the for having those players fit. It's unusual even it's a tortilla it stored.",ant

They appear to have turned a corner, but I'm still not sold fully when the pressure comes on. The squeeze comes on will their young Lads upfront Alex amount and Abraham and call still produce the goods week in week out. I think I think they have enough experience behind them. Hmm.

I'm you spoke about how he'll Steve Bruce is is he's not a modern manager at he doesn't have what it takes to keep that team in the Premier League, but I think just by the virtue of there's got to be some teams that are a little bit more little bit worse.

There there five points off City 4.5 hours and it's not exactly a massive asked by any shape or form. I know it is early in the season, but with turkey games to go that's not a massive know it isn't snot or not at all. Okay and a bottom tray. Okay, my bottom three are Watford gone Norwich gone.

So they had a aren't a strong personal voice. Yeah, both whatever system. They seemed it working the system that our plan is working because they are not conceding two goals.

He went after Henderson after that mistake, like he gave it him like you to know and I think whatever if you're doing it in a dressing room, but he did it to the media.

2572, Obviously stuck to penalty he's very very good penalty Taker and then they got a very late goal to it to seal the win and like West Ham pause a hell of a lot more of a challenge was there more solid at the back the very good going forward with that. We've seen that this season and they'll score against Palace Palace or slow at the back don't like don't like that overall Squad at all their best player doesn't want to beat her at all and he hasn't really done much to season so looked me to knittle to Northwestern that's exactly the scar. I was gonna go for,ant
2573, That end goal account is now back which will be a massive boost. If solidified the defense to Maury has been a massive addition as really quite as really stepped up to the plate and it just the club itself just seems like it has a massive Goodwill wave. Everyone is loving it. Like even I saw a Paddy Power had a tree topper a couple of days ago and he said I surely there's some sort of meetings for people who are finding themselves actually liking Chelsea Lately can go to her and cure themselves. And that's the way it is people and used to kind of this kind of good.,bee
2574," Yeah. Yeah, you be sick of hearing about it you guys. Yeah, and I suppose we're going to have to talk about the biggest game of the weekend, which was Liverpool City. Yeah, that was a lot of game as like everyone knows where about Liverpool fans. Yeah, but if you remove yourself that from that for a second and just put yourself in the shoes of a neutral what a game that was to watch like it had everything it did it like the city came out like a house on fire had all the possession looked the more dangerous by an oil and then buying for being your 25 yards out.",bee
2575," Let's have a look a little bit down the table a teams that maybe aren't doing as well as they would have expected to be done. I'm particularly looking at Arsenal and Spurs and who are at very different ends of the table Arsenal and six put their recent record. They won't to in their last five is it? Yeah, they have to end of no won't one of their last five in the last div last 2 that is 5 and 1 won the game. Yeah. Yeah. So they've it's an atrocious record for us not to me. They won't I think it's two of their last 12 or two of the last 11.",ant

They have no hope of catching - they don't and I know it's early junctures, but they don't they won't make up that ground because city, are you even predicting City to lose another four games this season, you know, I mean that's 12 points right there that would mean Spurs that have to win every game this season more or less and you know, what there we go. It kind of mathematically says it all and you're and but you might",ant

No other players they have if did you see any of their game and weekend against Burnley? It was as bad a primarily performance as maybe even southampton's against Lester it was that bad. Wow, they were that porno and that's and that's saying something Burnley could have scored fire my more rolls. It was just a ridiculously poor performance. They were as flat and I'm pretty sure Cresswell went off injured and I don't know what his situation is now off hand.",ant

They did the hounding at their heels in in normal seasons of teams weren't so floundering. So I wouldn't say it has been unreal either from Newcastle in you can still the count discount them from the relegation battle. I wouldn't do that to hastily either but they have out performed what we thought they would because we thought that be hopeless and rooted to the bottom and as you as you said,",ant
2579," For a don't see Arsenal are united picking up enough points to reel them back in because they're just too inconsistent. Okay, and when you say the same top four awards that were looking at now are we looking at the order to check out of finishing? Oh, no, I Liverpool I think City. I think City will eventually cop the novel a cup on because they're still have started the season relatively. Well gosh, maybe not of Man City standards, but haven't been terrible at the season, you know, but I think City will finish second.",ant
2580," We'll say six points, right? Yeah, do you think City will go on a clean run all the way through Christmas whenever a game if Liverpool drop Six Points then they have to go to the Eddie had a new year. Yeah. That's your nine point gap con valid, right participate, but that I'm just I'm just I'm just saying don't know what he lose the role of themselves. Yeah. Oh no 100% like this is so cute. People forget that what this city team can do never forget what they did at the end of last season granted Liverpool.",ant

So that is actually this game week 13 fixture is absolutely huge. Yeah, it really is because a lot of wine of all teams going win. Well, they actually can toggle and Celeste Irwin Liverpool win and it comes down to the last game that result is huge for our club because yeah the with the form that the other three are in they're not going to drop that many points because everyone else is floundering everyone else is dropping points, but these teams are the ones that aren't",ant

I suppose there is going to be a bit of a teething period he's going to have to get to know all the all the players intricacies in that kind of over the next quarter over the course of the next few weeks, but I'd nearly make a prediction here in our bold enough one. I can see Mourinho lacking this, you know that he's gonna know he's like, he's been banging that drum for years when he was at United that the squad is frail. He knows every weakness in that Squad and he's going to be having",ant

I know they've it was a probably a moral Victory against City that they were just as good as if he were probably under they may be unlucky not to get a point out of it and yet he had but this was a different kettle of fish altogether. Yes, but sometimes bad performance it was a bit of a blow because Chelsea are doing so well and like we said it last week that there was nothing we could see nothing but a Chelsea win.",ant
2608," In Chelsea will have got a shock from that West Ham game and I'd be looking for a response and I think Villa will probably fall victim to that. And so I know I'm going to go with a Chelsea win. You probably find out a lot about this Chelsea team to on Wednesday. That's actually a valid point because look this will be chance to properly rebound now. All right, will it be a team that flounders too often the season to be a tough work and her you'll probably find out a lot about them this winter. Well, I'm going to go with a Chelsea win. Anyway, let's move on to the next fixture we're going to talk about which is Man City Burnley Burnley are born they are worrying me.",ant

But the results he's getting with them. You have to have to hand it to him. No matter what you think of Steve Bruce. He's doing a good job, please but again, it's not a massively small sample size, but we'll see now December and January is where you'll find out where Newcastle are. I know you know that will December will make a massive difference to this to this team. Like they are too short angles like",ant
2610," No, but I just wouldn't see direct there are Rumblings and it does I suppose there's been Rumblings with a lot of clubs that have grouped by replacing managers. There's Rumblings with Arsenal and this particular manager, but there are Rumblings that allegri has been having talks with United. Yeah, I was half wondering and I know I can't remember was it yourself detention or wasn't it was another friend of mine that he had received really strong information to the Legree was going to be the next Arsenal manager last time.

Now. I know it was at Old Trafford. Mmm, and I know the Rivalry is there put the Rivalry is nearly as big with City like, oh it is it is now because of where the static the stature of both clubs definitely it is it's become a real proper rivalry in college before I wasn't and you know, like City aren't the best city, you know their limits and a lot of players and Aguero mine.",ant
2612, Cast it's really helped Marco silver can package that performance further players if he can if he can get them to buy into how well they played and how well that new formation work for them. Then I think they stand a chance of turning things around they do I really hope they do because because silver is a good manager and they have good players and they just kind of got caught in the funk did 80 and a funky. It just it went on a bit longer than anyone even anticipated and it won't help put her injury of and regardless and,ant
2613," So again, it's a bit like Everton if they can carry if they can continue to play like that and then Arsenal have a lot to worry about because they're going to London Stadium. Yeah, it's Monday night. So I don't know what it is. But I always find that Home Advantage counts. This is probably not statistically fact in any way shape or form, but I always find it on the Monday Night Football fixture harder to go away from home now. It's not a massive distance.",ant

I think they're going to get a bounce off that I think there was a there was a lot of rumors floating floating around floating around that Pellegrini was gone. There was rumors that raffle was going to take his job and I think the weekend was really the player standing up and saying no we're getting behind this manager and we want them to stay and work on a play for them. And that was a good sign because normally even if a manager has lost a team has lost a team.",bee

I don't think it'll be easy. I said I said that last week about a few games. I was proven right about some of these games can be very very hard, but they might find a way and I think this will be Lester. I think this would be less is one they'll find a way but they will be made sweat. Yeah. Yeah. All right and Liverpool are traveling to the vitality.",ant
2616," And obviously mistakenly thought that the - that kind of gap between 1517 has spread out.

That's where Bournemouth why Bournemouth have to steady the ship here and trying maybe get a result. Yeah. I mean director de way to Crystal Palace midweek, which they would hope to get three points from that now it's not an easy place for anyone to go. But if it wasn't that format will be looking at that as a place. They want three points. They'll want to get a result. Anyway put it",ant
2617," That way before their fifth but II do think for this fixture at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. I do think that I think they'll get a result against Burnley. They're too good. They probably will I agree with you even if Josie wasn't there if it was any other manager that spores that currents Poor Side are too good not to be Burnley. Hmm.

Did you ever think that you could",ant

But I you know, I did I imagine might set up tiny bit more defensively away from all around field and do what to did the city and try and hit him on the counter. Yeah. That's that's what Spurs did and at times if Spurs didn't have to sit. So deep like you had more going on those Meandering kind of crusading runs. Yeah and getting caught down for free after free, but he actually was causing the back to trouble with his speed and his elusiveness. Yeah, I can see.",ant
2621, I think that would be interesting. God does come to fruition. That is what United successfully did in the in the reverse fixture back at all Trafford. They just they didn't let Trend Alexander Arnold and Robertson get out of there their own half and that will be what they're looking to do again and right I'm gonna go I can't decide where I can go to one to Liverpool or 1 1 so you could find the United to do PD. It may be the only team to take points but to do it twice. Yeah. I just can't I just because just Farm goes out the window.,bee
2622," Come back to this fixture Crystal Palace have taken checked us on unknown from Everton. I think it's good move for him. It's called mail for Palace. He's not getting game time at Everton and they need goals badly policy goals, but not only that benteke is injured. So they need someone who can hold up the ball well, and he's good at that and he's tough and he can score the our goal here and there I think he's it's a good sign up for Palace it is it is it's a it was definitely needed not that been tacky had been brilliant. No, but he does like you does ask those are for something up front.",ant
2623," I thought I got my numbers right there. I might uh numbers mixed up. Yeah, I'm so they couldn't have more opposite form now watch would have been in Flying Farm and we actually mentioned that here when they played Liverpool to give them all sorts of trouble. Yeah and in an field and just that was no I think that was Nigel Pearson's first game in charge wasn't it? Yeah, its first official game in charge of try to and since he's come in it seems that he has founded the key whatever it is because obviously he's so it's solidified them and he's got him score. And again, he's brought Troy deeney back in Guinea as has been scorned.",ant
2624," Christian Eriksen got a very hard time from the crowd every time he passed the ball backwards and Ericsson in particular. I think that the fans are upset with him because he won't he's not signing a new contract and salvation a that's probably a personal thing rather than and in the first half there was a lot of moans and groans from the Spurs fans, but I think in the second half when Spurs started to show a bit more drive to compete in the game, I think that's when the fans got behind them and I think that affected Liverpool as well the fans getting behind sports or did affect Liverpool a little bit and Liverpool were Clinging On a bit.",bee
2625," Out the relegation battle is because of our next fixture which is quite possibly the biggest game of this game week it potentially for what sports club what's at stake. Yeah knowledge versus perform at its bottom versus second bottom both teams and horrible form.

They stood three there are three off of Bournemouth. Yeah.",ant
2626," I just snatch a victory even though they might deserve it. Yeah, and I think you could just kick start a bit of a run for them because they're just so under performing at the minute. I know they've injuries. Hmm, but they're still under performing. I think regardless of that obviously confidence is Lord have taken a few batarangs. Yeah, but they're capable. They're still capable and I just feel like this might be the one that cake stacked and I hope it is because I will know I don't give a shit about unbiased our - I want born with stay up like I do want to mention your own can't well then.",ant

I think I think I think the mood is Billa is is is hammered at this point, especially after that defeat against Manchester City. Yeah. I think that would be hard to pick them.

2629," I needed to turn up against Liverpool which is why I don't want to waste I thought it was very Shawna dying again. Now, I don't let it out. What we'll do is use this as a wonderful moment to plug our patreon. If you want Sean to get antibiotics in the doctor, you know what to do. Send us money. Anyway something that very much annoyed me at the weekend was I was watching the Arsenal Crystal Palace game, which finished",ant
2630," It's I think it's a silly comment from our in Chianti even come close to describing that as a step in the right direction. It isn't it isn't a step in the right direction. They be United to knit. That's a step in the right direction. Yeah that fucking drama Palace. Yeah. I know they went down to 10 men. Well that was 65 or 66 minutes into the game there to haul out for half an hour a man down. What big big whoop, that's not a step in the right direction. It's best to play at all. Yeah, and I think what you're trying to say is in the words of clouds from",ant
2631," I think they're I think the winners are not a plane In fairness stuff like that. They're playing really well at the minute. Yeah, they went to the king power and beat Lester. I mean they could be wolves but it's not Hamptons The Hamptons mean performance level over any five-game period isn't four wins and a draw. Yeah, they're gonna regress again soon. I'm wolves are delegates. They're so hard to be like, yeah. I know the last Liverpool and I can't remember who entered last on this drive me insane in the middle of it is recommend brain, but other than that are very hard to beat.",ant
2632," Yeah, so far this season if they get a point to game between now and the end of the season there comfortably staying in the Premier League. Our form has kind of taken a bit of a Dip Tour series. They've only got one point from the last four games. Yeah. It's not guaranteed that they're going to they're not going to do the same thing again, and they're released and Bruce's called a spade a spade and they don't have anyone up front. Yeah. Yeah, so I'm Ron and fairness. So he scored at weekend and he scored. I think it's entry was last six or three of his last 7 he started to click a small. But yeah, that's good. When is maximum back? I think he's back in next two weeks.",ant
2633," And first of all, just a little apology were recording this podcast a little bit what late it is Thursday evening. Normally, we like to do it earlier in the week, but work commitments got in the way and we do this for the love of the game. So we just have to fit in and around our schedules. So here we are on Thursday evening still plenty of time before the Premier League week batch week 12 kicks off. So, hopefully you get time to listen to it before the weekend. As I said, the big game of the week is of course the top of the table clash between Manchester City and Liverpool.",ant
2634," Go again, really on the Rafa. Yeah. Wow, that is a long time ago. 2003 Wow since last time City beat and field and that was Nicolas. Anelka. Was that not supposed to liaise time? Was it Julio? Sorry. I was right it was before it was before so that was my own fault. That's fell down on the Nicolas. Anelka scored two goals for City in Liverpool at anfield Premier League era when you had robbed.",ant
2635," that silly goes. Yeah, so it's not going to be the walk in the park that people think it is. No and it seeping out for Liverpool is a bigger thing than I think people are kind of estimation. He is now become without doubt the number two beside Van Dyke and Gomez since his comeback hasn't looked fully up to speed yet. And Lovin is dejan lovren that we've been given out about four years whether you love him or hate him, you know, he's prone to mistakes and he is just not as he's not as reliable as",ant
2636," you're going to have to probably provide to cover if the foot if it's going to be the type of game that I'm anticipating any way. We're going to see five or six goals and both defenses just not being able to cope with being overrun. Yeah, I can see Andy and trench has been deployed way far forward and you're gonna have Milner and Fab basically trying to plug holes. Yeah. Yes. That's how I see it, but I can just see be an absolute free for all this is that I know we this is an often predicted that all these are the two most attacking sides in the league and",ant
2637, Understandable to think that because nine points at the top of the Premier League considering how few points those both those teams drop is or nine points or 6 points is a massive Gap at the top of the Premier League pause.,ant
2638," If that is the pairing, I would really fear for our city. I think that they would be attacked time and time again down the flanks and I think that would pay dividends. We can't not touch on the absolute incredible form. That's audio man is on either exactly. He's been I think he's been the best player in the Premier League so hard for tomorrow. Anyway, maybe we could maybe the exception of Kevin De bruyne or I would I would not my heart to variety as well. He's untangled. Yeah, you know what he he's what he's the type of player you'd easily forgettable, but he's mr. Consistent and he's up there with",ant
2639," But again, both sides are conceding left right and Center little bit of won't lie and cheat as we said City are susceptible at the back without support and y'all at the various changes. They've had to make was in Janko now out as well and like just has to be able faster over to my mind it is but as I've said we've expected this before him we've gotten ill all's and wonder how the hell but I just don't see it. But me I see I think I'd see at least four or five goals and I really resent the upwards of that.",ant
2640," You you wouldn't have you wouldn't have given no Archer snowball's chance in hell. Hmm. But I'm just this season what would have been really lackluster and getting certain games now in some games? They've brought in a small but I think they've been much improved honor Flores. The I think didn't they have their has been elements of what was their owner Gracia, but that's always going to happen. There's going to be a transition period but I think there's definitely there's a glimmer of hope therefore what for fans and I think I think taking take three points with this.",bee
2641, Southampton have been poor and unlucky at the same time. They were massively partnership nine goals against Lester it with that was a ridiculous result. No team in the Premiership Premier League should ever be beaten by that. That's an embarrassment home is sure but they were brilliant again City and probably could have left the city of Manchester Stadium stadium with a point near if not all three. So there are two cells Hamptons as much as there are two ever or they did that's the thing you have the absolute Jekyll and Hyde of both clubs here.,bee
2642," obviously defensively very freely concede for but they show that they have a serious Sparkman series will going forward and I will I wouldn't I will I will say though in I know it's again, it's a Champions League game and we're not here to talk about Champions League games, but I Acts were trained elope in the first half against Chelsea and only had one shot on goal and incredible statistic is just Chelsea scored two on goals. Yeah that and that is an outlier. All right. Yeah. But anyway, I think moving on I think",bee
2643," That game where you know there because God help us in service. That was just as you said so abject terrible performance. Like I was watching that game and it was just all born but they were the only wanted a bit of creativity in life to them like, you know, so I'm yeah I can see I can see Newcastle. I can see no cats like this like this one at st. James's Park. I just think that if the farm Newcastle are in I think and the farm bar muttering I think Newcastle are going to gonna win it agreed and it's so it is one of those games though that could",ant
2644," I was against this at this I didn't and want to nil. I think and had one shot on target, but Spurs have shown this season already against Newcastle that they don't really have what it takes to deal with that. They can be frustrated yet. Everyone prostrated not sure hurricane had a virus is entire family had a virus. That's when he didn't play last weekend and he didn't play in the Champions League. Yeah. It's unlikely to play against Sheffield United easy. He's a doubt was what I read today. Yeah, Dad II actually read",ant
2645," And they have been good in periods. I think that was against Southampton from what I remember would be right was handsome. Yeah, but I'm it was because we land based at some bet Southampton for not even been able to raise a Gallop when they were one had a one-man offense Advantage, you know, I don't know I still just magically fancy fancy Spurs. I got a something like a 2-1, but I think she actually will raise a galloping on fairness. And so I really I'm gonna go with it. I'm gonna go with a drawn this one and",ant
2646," A plus the plus one plus one exactly after 11 games that will tell you exactly where isolated sees. Yeah, they've been lucky that the chips are fell where they are a lot of the time they have been very lucky allowed at a time. Yeah. So I you know, I am really is confusing me at the moment because",ant
2647," A false that's a pretty Falls woman. You looked at they've only scored one more hold and if can see there, I mean, well they are six points behind Fort. Yeah, so that's probably a fair I figure kind of standard of where they are bought and our new favorite team Sheffield United are only one point below and I hope the blades anyway, I'm gonna make a prediction. My prediction is last time for this one. Yeah, just because it's at the king power and Lester absolutely flying same as yeah. Let's say we glazed over it because I nearly slipped into a coma when I read it the first",ant
2648," Anyway, we're not that's not we're not here to talk about our but we are here to talk about Aston Villa and I think and don't like quite like Sheffield United their side that are belonging the fact that they've just come up into the Premier League this season. Oh, yeah. I said it I numerous podcast that they weren't getting results earlier in the season. So that's going to turn around because they're paint a steel all and they can yeah Greeley's has been the star for them this season. He's been classed. Well, I would say Tyrone wings as before yesterday.",ant
2649," I think I think that their their problems are are away from home more. So a wave, uh, definitely I did. Yeah the crowd in in all fairness know and always lagging what you know, yeah, like put the crowd in Old Trafford gets them over like the hell. Yeah. They remained us. They want to aren't they won't want it away game this season, but before that they hadn't worn one since I can March or something of of yeah last season and there's definitely something needs to be sorted out that you know, and I'm not I've",ant
2650," You could die. So he knows himself off as a bother but he knows the Premier League inside out. Yeah and Everton have some good players at Silva isn't getting to get into work. But anyway on that bombshell and I think that you know, it is are absolutely shite but they are going to win this game against Brighton because of that Old Trafford and Brighton are not as good. So that's that is my summation of that and on what's your prediction? This one is so hard to call. It depends on what and United shows up if the crowd Galvanize them and they actually put in a bit of a performance.",ant
2651," They want to find out where teams are like the likes of say maybe man united are Spurs or a snot. We're going to find out very soon where they probably safe to season exactly and that brings us on to our first game week. I think it's very nicely we'll start off by talking about which I think on paper doesn't sound like the most scintillating of fixtures, but I think this one is really intriguing meant Manchester United at Leicester city in the yeah, it's em this going to be an interesting fixtures going to be tough for you know the day",ant
2652," And every United fan wants to see him do well. I know, you know, your fan wants to be the one to turn around and say you need to be sacked. But if it was any other manager if it was anyone that was brought in from outside the club they be open arms at this ball big time. As you said your stat there is tells the last three wins out of his last 16 is it's a stat that wouldn't be tolerated in Manchester United in Years Gone by and I don't know whether it's a kind of weakening of the standpoint of the club where they demanded great.",ant
2653," It is it is it's again not an easy fixture for Chelsea's was playing noise football. Yeah, they're in the Europa League is out there. Sorry that may be because they came up from the championship. So so recently that teams maybe don't give creditor but there is something that can play football like and we should so also got a draw against United recently. They can play against the big teams like they did. I think it was the fifth or sixth best defensive record in the Premier League last year. Yeah. They're well able to defend that they can move the ball forward.",ant
2654," I know you're a know your argument. Why do you really gain and you're gay you're not gaining much and you're probably sacrificing more in the long run. Yeah, I know there is basically the just obviously a financial Kickback board. I think there comes a point where you have to say, we're going to make a lot less money in the championship. So it is a really work to financial kickbike. Yeah it is. It's it off when it's a tough one, but I am I supposed getting back to the task at hand, which is the Premier League this Chelsea game. All right now, all right.",ant
2655," For free. Yeah, you're probably in bonus territory already know what Eric's and Richard Ivey fact, you have them on Christmas, which is probably a boost that they needed because like a lie isn't really added at the minutes. Look we've seen him before. So I think they kind of need his creation. They need his spark alongside son, too. Yeah to really be the impetus in the forward line to his to feed the beast that is cane like an yeah, I think it's far as fans will have breathed a collective sigh of relief that he is still there after the transfer deadline. So I'm",bee
2656," They could roll or something like that. It seems to be what DMO of this and while these fixtures have been a bit tasty in previous years. Obviously, it was a late goal from I think was dibakar Iggy last see the end of last season that kept Liverpool on track to battle for the title the rescue the two one like Newcastle. No Rafa. No looking. No rougher. No way Jose Perez, no midriff each. No matches be not Richard for two months Richie.",leech
2657," I'll use Photo made early doors and Newcastle came back and rescue the draw but it was a deserve draw to be honest. Like the castle were probably the better team and I came so that probably sounds over Watford are at the minute and I just don't see we saw in the second half against Spurs as an overflowing. Yeah, you know, it's going forward. They were flowing now Spurs obviously have their own questions answered about what was going on at the back there with the backboard I played but I recently looked rampant and they could have scored for for even that second half against Spurs and it wouldn't surprise me if this",ant
2658," Goals, this could be one of those one needles are one all's I just don't really know or care. It's going to be one of these fixtures that is way down the list and not you today. And your it's going to get about three minutes coverage from a tree today. So that's all the deserves the most will not yeah, I'm going to go one nail sailed Hampton. That's fair enough. Yeah, because you're a Southampton fan because like everybody knows that I have a soft spot for Asylum. Yeah, that's fair enough bright and Burnley has nail all written all over it. Oh, I don't know Brighton can't defend it.",leech
2659," Nick something from this game and I think probably won't they'll perform it. I don't think I think I think things are sour at ever. Maybe maybe I think the next few games out a lot and Everton season. Yeah. It'll out. What where did where did I missions? Lawyer? I think will it be portion Clause Europa League type of thing. We're leaving me table and fans disillusion. I don't know. I don't know what it is, but it's probably as you say tinfoil hat stuff, but just looking at Mark of Silver's facial expression on the sidelines the last few games.",ant
2660," Mid-table mediocrity. Yeah, so you're liking his Mantra ring through which more? Yeah, that's what they hope for that's the best they can aim for but you know, it's better than fighting for the relegation which they have been in previous Seasons very recently. So it is and they won't they won't be there this year just quad is just too good for that. They just won't they get their little just accrue enough points that they'll be safe by Christmas our January type deals, you know, they'll know maybe they won't be mathematically there, but they'll know they will be there come April or May so you can concentrate that I'm being",ant
2661," When I saw her laying out on Saturday, I thought you know a lot here this team suits him. They have a relatively strong back for very interesting study classical very interesting that he left Erickson on the bench. So it is it is right. And if you looked at the team, he said up here the back for Sanchez strong man brought in you had wings and dire both sitting as he likes to protect the back for and then he has cane as well as the target man up front. That is the way José Mourinho plan is the archetypal Millennial. Yeah, so I think this team",ant
2662," 45 even before people have listen to this podcast this week. Yeah, you're looking at Pellegrini. You're going to Marco Silver Moon. I am re Ralph hasn't huddle. That's that's far right off the bat. Yeah that look like they could lose their job very sharpish and all you go. There's our job. Is this a problem about himself Time by - by snatching Metrology family are prepared from seven minutes in that game. He was probably going to lose his job. Yeah straight after so there's going to be I mean I text you over the weekend and I said, there's got to be absolute Carnage.",ant
2663," The on getting party and he's seen as a club Legend there and and they want to replace. I don't know why for some crazy reason they want to replace Thomas to who who has the Mad flying at the top of the league, but I think I hit a small obviously the perceived European shortcomings and has to be dedicated to Falling at it. They look like we've seen him in some debacles in Europe in recent years and it's kind of like man city. It's just that falling at the final hurdle a lot in Europe and obviously just want someone to take them to the next level and we see",ant
2664, A lot of signs de Peppa starting to feel the pressure a little bit. He's not his normal composed assured cocky self. Oh 100% even on the sidelines on Saturday when he was bringing players on you could see him remonstrate in like mad with him trying to drill what he wanted from them. You could tell he was really really wanted to treat pain instead. He knew that they had to win now what ramifications that they have in the Premier League. We just don't know but he knew that I came was I just a must-win and there was no other result. I could be tolerant like if you,ant
2665," Because and I must say when I say we've pretty much pull down your pants and shatter Newcastle all here because we thought they were testing to go down and all the to in the fashion their season started and the mood around the club, but In fairness to Steve Bruce in the squad, they've rallied around him and they've given it everything and they're shown they're getting results for now and Josh fair play to them and I do think they're going to frustrate City for a long while in this type of toy bearing obviously City doing what to do to some teams in scorn really early in just controlling it from the outset. But if Newcastle can hold them for a half an hour",ant
2666," I think he began in January. Yeah, you should have been gone in August by looks of it. I think the fact that he didn't start with Ericsson this the weekend just gone spoke volumes interestingly didn't start for tongue and later. So Oliver Alan Sanchez, I wonder if it wasn't even in the squad. Yeah. Is he? I don't know if he's injured did he get injured playing with Belgium running? I doubt he would even been playing because they were qualified or anti. But anyway, that's a European different competition different gravy. But I just noticed that neither the men maybe he's just going to say look here completely. Maybe that was the first thing he did. He said look lay down the law.",ant
2667," Teams around the top six you can take that on the chin, but when the team that is rock bottom of the table hasn't worn in months comes to your home ground and you've invested that mount of money in this in the squad and that amount of money in your manager and you get walked over.",ant
2668," Mm. Yeah, I remember now what that Evans did go off and where's Morgan came on for right? And that's not a bad date the were stepping in the world. Although he's not blessed with payers by any means but he's a unit and he'll do a job that you've got chai onto their who's an absolute. I can't believe you don't need to worry about Pace last what a find for them water Point absolutely brilliant. But anyway, we might as well wrap this up because we're both in agreement. Yeah going to be a very tough idea afternoon at the office. Yes Trevor. It's three points for Lester's all you can really see. Let's move on to wolves.",ant
2669," Put it dude are a brilliant brilliant watch it him innocent Dirk. They're getting results. And again, we've said it multiple times a season when all T. In other teams are floundering. They're Rock Solid. They haven't lost a game in 5 again and we came here. Maybe what we were Tartine weeks in maybe nine weeks ago. Yeah when they were in the the kind of throws of the Europa League at the start of the season they were suffering for it. You could see it. They played something like twenty four fixtures all day Heidi. I don't know that I think there are closer to 30 now. They had to hop a good few weeks ago that play 24, but I'm",ant
2670," I don't know. This is a real tough game for me to call. I I really but I realize what what for turn up. I think I really like both sides as you know, mmm, and I really like both managers and I kind of want them both to win because I want them both to get out of this funk that they're in mmm, but they're not doing anything to instill any confidence in me. No, I think God it's hard to call I think Southampton because they're at home. I think the mood is terrible at both clubs, but Southampton will get the left of their home fans.",ant
2671," The next while especially December is going to be ridiculous. So I think they'll try put this one to bed early and if they can if they can score a goal or too early, they will win and then win comfortably if Brighton can hang on and Dangle on there might get a draw but I to me, I think that's slim chance and it no chance of a way of writing winter. We honestly I think this is going to be fairly run-of-the-mill trainer and fixture for Liverpool to be honest. And I don't I don't like speaking that confidently about Liverpool, but I just don't think Brighton are good enough to even stay in the Premier League. Never mind get a point against",ant
2672," Emery is probably in trouble. I don't know who they're going to get to replace them. But I think you gave me a start there before we started a podcast. Yeah this came up and I'll match it today. I can claim credit for this one. It came up on Match. Today's Twitter. I think it was but I am I some haven't won a Premier League game as as of was recording on Monday nights. They haven't won a Premier League game in 50 days. Wow, seven weeks. That's that's a long time. It's certainly isn't it time. We are recording this on Monday night. So I'm just going to take a quick check on the Monday Night Football.",ant
2673," Like its prime now, obviously, they showed that they still have some high-quality footballers with what they did to Stacey ran for the united in a lot of seven or eight minute period you know so that they are well able at times but are not showing it enough. I think they are pulling off results at home without playing. Well. Yeah, and that is probably the same with Villa but they're not getting any results away from home. This games at Old Trafford. So it probably expect them to win but like you say, they've been so poor. Yeah, and I'm",ant
2674, Another thing that you see in alienation cases is they the parent who's favored will refuse to force the children to go and visit the non favored parent. So what does that look like in that situation? What we'll see is a parent who says something like I can't make my child get in the car or I can't make my child visit or,ant
2675," Even as I've been going through describing these things. So how do you prove them in court? Well, first of all, what I say to people is that when we're in court we have to show and not just tell and so what that means is that we have to have some kind of tangible way of showing the court that these things are can happen. And that doesn't mean that you have to have video recordings or tape recordings. All those can be good if they're allowable where you live we don't have to have that.",bee
2676, other parent interfering in the relationship or the visitation with the other parent bad-mouthing confiding in their child about things that really are not appropriate for a child to know or portraying the other parent as dangerous are some great things to look at if you're dealing with a situation where there's parental alienation or in strange moment involved.

You can find the Morgan State game or whatever on Right video somewhere exactly, but they are struggling badly. They gave them 62 points to Kent State. I guess.

Yeah, it's different that's different. And that's and then the guy the second round draft pick did not prepare for the seasoned properly and he didn't handle any of it properly, but I just don't get the Kelly part here with book. I don't think Brian Kelly has a to do this. I'm not saying their quarterbacks 10 regress in the past. Obviously they did or they didn't progress. Tommy Reese didn't progress. Okay. Well so that lady Plateau the next",bee

Yeah, he said for starters when they go nickel probably be Jeremiah who succour MOA which they don't really play like true nickel now, they've been playing back. It's like they go from base to Dime. So I don't I don't know how that fits into the mix if that just means he may have taken it as the nickel back in the dime set instead of being Sean Crawford will be Jeremiah program, right?

He's back in and really rolling tour of Notre Dame a little bit in the first of all not a little bit tour of Notre Dame the first half last year 12 catches over a hundred yards.

Like Notre Dame is better than Virginia Tech, but Virginia Tech does things that puts Notre Dame in a bind and see how they respond to it. Do you not think I mean, this is how I'm thinking especially on defense. I've said this a couple times Clark Ali's defense is going to react very very well.

He's a tight end quote combat sort of like an athlete who can do a little bit of everything. Yeah. I think they have to replace it in the aggregate they do and let me throw in this question, which is a follow up with the now.",ant
2834," I thought they would be settling in a rotation but there seems to be a lot of uncertainty. Well, I mean we said in the spring and the summer and going into the fall that this is a competition that could continue through August and maybe even into the season I guess we kind of made it sound like you know, I said Jack Lambs going to be the starter Bilal fits the mic position and we know about oh Sook or MOA, but they were still in Culver. It is still the first week of football practice and",ant

But question I heard right talking to people around him. There's like he when he gets beat he's kind of like holds back a little bit and I don't know. I don't know since that night. I haven't sensed that at all. And of course Harrison Leonard certainly flashed they were Hamlet player the day as well one day jay Bramblett, so we were really excited about seeing Bramblett.",ant
2836," Say that no, they won't and it will really show because their linebackers are also not going to pick up where they left off. It's just it's a bad combination of things when you have a interior defense line. That's just okay and linebackers were you don't know what the heck they're going to be on the flip side says the talk about the competition Arron Banks shows. No ill effects now about that. I had a good day yesterday. We all thought he had a good day yesterday. I thought the offensive line was really physical with the running backs that gives you can see the approach couple.",ant
2837," We're not sure about that, you know Olmstead kind of seems like a guy that's trending in that direction. And sometimes you just when a guy comes in you sometimes know Michael Jones.

I think it's good. I would save Kramer's good and Patterson's what we think their top ten. Right? And if Norton's interior offensive line is now regularly beating or Dame's interior defensive line than Tommy Kramer must be doing something at top five is you're getting to the elite a lot of Pro Prospects that are coming out this year. I",ant
2839," Multiple radio shows I bet on when I asked about what's the prognosis for the season last year's team would not go undefeated against this your schedule, but I still like last year's team more than lee district and I would like last year's team going into the Georgia situation more to with the change to book because you have dudes like Tillery and love out there till and Kony and tranquil the hold it down. It's actually an is make my own pointer or not. But when already opened with Michigan last year, I've thought to myself",ant

No, you're not gonna get on your own you guys only have to work you have to recruit to that level. Do you? I don't think because of Love played this still is a game that Notre Dame does not win because they can't score right eye. I don't know what if miles bookings right or not what he's saying he was separating receiver in there open. I think receivers say that no matter what",ant
2842," You know, I just maybe this is Maybe the owner named fans get so upset. But my God, I mean maybe Norton can't be the best football team in the country, right? But by one take away from this is the again just didn't play that well either like maybe they maybe third maybe they're not coach to play that well, maybe they don't believe in it as much as we think maybe they're just not fast and strong enough. They didn't play that. Well, they didn't they didn't play recorder. It's like people say well we showed up.",ant

I know there is speculation on the message board that he was preserving himself when he got hurt.

Would you you would not walk into practice right now thinking you're going to see during gem Markeith all of a sudden rotate with the ones anymore, right? You'd be surprised. I wouldn't notable thing. I would be surprised. Yeah and Veterans like John Jones are not rotating their way up now Boba, we haven't not gonna beat out Drew.

We like the way the he looks in the way. He's played Jerry Patterson the interior offensive line for the most part has gotten the best of the Interior defensive line since the spring game not so much the other day when they went live but patent so Paris in a center has to be a huge part of that and then my number one pick although I",ant
2846," It affects he's beaten and and the the worst quarterbacks that that defeated Bryan Kelly's not empty. I had to look what up to look what up and really guessing another but Stanford when they beat the 2016 Irish it was Ryan Burns, which is just incredible because you can name Stanford's quarterbacks off the top of your head or immediately and Andrew Luck Kevin Hogan. He danced until he had just beat now Keller Crystal. Yeah, Chris and jot in Chris was injured gotten in but Burns want and then the one I had to look up at a sad because we references game all the time.",ant
2847," Chris think 2019. I agree. That's why I'm trying to tie it into the previous one because I think he becomes a deep ball threat I want to but because of his route running the way he can find a hope openings down the seam to the corners. You would like to see a guy like I think he's will emerge and be a player this year that they that they rotate in and I think Michael Young can get deep to I would like to see brain lenzi have a and this is not that made up. Hey, he's fast put them in run straight roll. I want to see brain lenzi be a legitimate backup wide.",ant

2849," You know, I think you you know, we were just kind of alluding to it you for snored aim to beat you with their passing game. You try to take their running game away, which has been that, you know teams have done that it causes a little panic.",ant
2850," That's when it gets ugly. Right? I agree a couple questions here is from at Jordan Pollock is filled your Kovac looking more like a solid backup the handbook at this stage. Could he lead our team to Victory against teams? Like Louisville, New Mexico Duke Navy and Boston College. Those are different level teams lead our team to victory over New Mexico. Lewis will be interesting to see pretty nervous. I think. Yeah, I mean as a",ant
2851," Questions on the outskirts of it when they really don't fill it in that much because those people are like the guys that used to sit in the gold seats and go to Florida for basketball games. Now, that is a stadium Lot. It's I would cultural Elite plus some holes. I would throw the defensive ends and safeties into Stadium. Let Personnel my defensive ends and safety lot is Joyce lot the gold standard of tailgating. I grew out there that care is Tailgater on the south side coming back from Atlanta. I tailgated there everybody. I know tell Gates there. That's the gold standard. Okay. Why?",bee
2852," That was a good call. I just I didn't think that I didn't think Penn State would score 28 against them quite frankly and I didn't think that Michigan would score 21 and really it should have been should have been that that eighth touchdown of the game near the end with Ronnie belt. I think the I agree with what I'm always saying like Notre Dame spy week is the most important intangible, but I also think like the way that game went the crowd on Saturday night should be a little bit more like",ant
2853," Adams was running the offense. He wanted to run not the offense that actually use the players that he had that Saturday was really one of the first times you're like, okay, I can see like how you could bring these two ideas together. But man, I mean Tim I think us Brian Kelly about their receivers and I don't know if you compared them to USC or like it lying there and knew they weren't the same and that's why I just want to enroll a code and use and the other one is like talented but not I mean that's",ant
2854," Lionel Hamilton's pick-6. Was that like a ball now? It's just like the bulkhead. I mean turnovers are kind of cyclical. They're forcing fumbles is more of an impressive thing. Of course, a lot of folks that are kind of random like the defensive lineman for some bubbles happen sometimes right? I feel like the pass rush enforcing fumbles is something that could play a role with shape Patterson these a freshman Tech freshman right tackle here when you're making quarterbacks fumble. That's a yeah, and and she Patterson is that's sweet.",bee
2855, USC didn't really even try that. So that's that as probably whoever gets it. What concerns you is one size that does that really does that even things out I don't think that that evens things out if you can't make the play on the ball. Yeah. Well he be managed like I think Nico Collins is the toughest matchup because he can catch a he could turn like a little hitch routes where you missed the tackle. He can make you missed the tackle with his strength so I could see him. I liked Niko columns more than in what they're doing then I like the,ant
2856," And I want some more of this week. I mean kind of like book really in that once he wants he gets flushed. He has very difficult time scoring back up the line of scrimmage and when they don't square up to the line of scrimmage or not, very effective. I do want to throw this in Michigan as 23 sacks defensively, which is pretty big number and again tying in with Don Brown his aggressiveness and going after people opponents have 12 against them, which is a fairly High number.",ant
2857," Right. Now they're safety is out there what I want to be but not thinker not fikret on that figure young either. I'm saying that this is the only defense you'll face where you can put Claypool outside. You can move bigger. Yoga outside doesn't matter if Lindsey's in the game when you have Lindsey and Commander, this is the only defense that will actually attempt to say let's go one-on-one because they want to get there right through the planets again. I am very interested to see how clay pull handles and it's difficult to watch all the things we want to watch but how Claypool Hamels getting press the last",ant
2858," Applying there for somebody to respond. No, I mean I'm gonna try to throw a couple questions in here from Twitter Mason plumber six. Do you believe backup Michigan backup quarterback? Dylan McCaffrey would pose more problems in order to in the shape Patterson if he were to start. No, although I probably would have said yes in September totally agree. That's my Patterson was real bad, but then he was pretty good on Saturday. So I'll say that he's going to be better than that. They're not going to",ant
2859," So that's rough 93. If you look at this, there are nine a half Point Underdog to go up there and light up Michigan and guess I said coming to the look like Randall Cunningham only a better thrower. I too have to pick 98 or 88 89 in other. I'm sure 99 just because one versus two the magnitude of it at the time 88 you still figured Miami is going to come in and ruin the fun at that point because they just barely they discard offensive touchdown 88 either.",ant
2860, Askew so when it seems ask you you probably don't know as much as the person that made that line I will leave it with this to tease it. Well three things it would've been a bigger loss for demanding lost last year in this game because I would have turn that season into a big Funk of nothingness and they won that game and it propelled them to go to the playoffs. They're not going to playoffs this year. I don't think it'd be better. It would not be a great loss because everything is within their grasp to go 11 and 1/4 really good year. I have never missed.,ant
2861," What gives you guys the confidence and Notre Dame can avoid some of that sloppy football that we saw Saturday night between Miami and Florida. I think veteran quarterback and he in book veteran receivers Veteran running backs veteran offensive line. I think their offense will be crisp defensively. I don't expect many breakdowns of all, I don't know how much they're going to bring an added pressure because Louisville's lying is offensive line is a major weakness still. Yeah. They do have a future Pro in Makai beckton, but your name",ant
2862, 2010 their name 23 Purdue 12 stop and start game awkward offense good defense 2011 South Florida 2320. The turnovers just turnovers 2012 5210 over Navy defense was incredible. Run first offense Manti Te'o was amazing 2013 Notre Dame 28 6. / Temple defense was still really good quarterback play was limited 2014 14 17 over rice with everybody healthy.,ant
2863," Even be completely awake, but he was a coach killer.",ant
2864," Saturdays ago, they're not expecting anything out of Michael Jones. They are expecting a contribution from Javon McKinley Camp heart is a possibility. So he's a varsity player still Kim heart kind of yeah, it was they have to have a seventh after Ramen has been banged up and I'm not sure his development as a receiver because he hasn't been a receiver until he got here. What about Braden Lindsay next year? I just think next year. I really do and I and I and I and I strongly suspect that. That is what",ant
2865," He doesn't have to get hit generally speaking. You know, I mean you can picture how many times he outruns a guy to the corner. That's when usually went to play breaks down. I wish I brought it don't know why I didn't bring my paper stats, but I think he ran for 27 first downs last year that's important part of the office, right? It really is. He had 27 first downs and that's in nine starts. Yeah nine starts. So that's needed that that's definitely you want to track that this year. Yeah. No, I do track just don't have been to bring the piece of paper to make it valuable right now for yeah podcast look suc cornerback, Isaiah Langley.",ant
2866, Really good. We used to I felt I felt definitely going to last year because I felt it had to be with Brandon wimbush a running a run-heavy offense because he couldn't function throwing them all but now I agree with you. Yeah. Now the short passing game is it extension actually almost is just that an Athens were so fast that it that's that mean that is when you talk about differentiator the ability of your running backs to catch a football. That's an e-book to put it right there. Right that can be absolutely differentiated. We're skipping that next question because we addressed it.,ant
2867," And that's really impressive engineer Smith is made for the single back. Yeah, two running backs and slide right see behind. He just doesn't have great hands. I know he doesn't have great hands because Chip Long made him redo a rep where the quarterback missed him. You're not making Tony Jones redo a rep of the corner because he wants to get you the ball as many times as you can I do want to say that, you know the first reaction or the reaction the first time a running back loses a fumble.",ant
2868," I'm looking forward to Georgia. But yeah you throw Albuquerque back to back out to Virginia that be fun USC all the time. Do you see before a by I might not go home till Thursday? Great. Let's see. That would be awesome. Okay, here we go last question from at DEA Dixon 408 will the Irish illustrate staff make all of your prop bets public and will Irish illustrates subscribers be able to participate maybe make it a season-long make a season-long contest out of it.",ant
2869," New coach obviously, you're going to give got the other guys. Look I'm interested to see what Satterfield does because he's always just reading about him. He's always ahead of the curve. He's gonna throw something new at Notre Dame because that's their only shot. So I'm more interested to see what he pulls out. Whoo, boy watching your instant analysis. I think pre-service made a reference to running a 3 3 5 against Tyrone swoop gave him some serious like yeah, I think like I said four to five and I meant I meant three three five. Yeah, you know Joanne pet. I agree. He may just be a single thread not",ant
2870," With book in place and the line being much more experience of they were going to last year's first couple games that I don't think they're going to miss a beat against the bed defense. I think they rely think it's a plug and play against a bad defense. I don't think it's plug and play against a great team, but they're but they're not they're not and I'm not disagreeing with you. I mean ordained could win by 45, but they're not going to be as bad of Defense as they were last year they can top. So no, of course not but I mean math later I still have some yes.",ant
2871," Is he coordinating defense? How do you not get fired for a second time midseason just maybe be able to be around because they don't have an athletic director as strong-willed as nor name does perhaps hashtag four-part series? All right. Let's talk about the depth chart here real quickly. We got a depth chart yesterday. It was amended after the press conference when Brian Kelly spoke about his back up inside linebackers, and neither one of them were on the",ant
2872, And I just feel like as much as I think they can go undefeated at home and I did put it in a prediction in Monday musings because they have two home games. They cannot lose one. They really should not lose if they're any good in Navy and then so you beat the to Virginia's BC and USC. I,bee
2873," We're done. All right, that that helps but I just think Sanford Stadium at night. Oh sure first. I mean that's just going to be a total hornets nest. I can't wait. I love that. I love going into places like that. There's no",ant
2874," I feel like this game. Yeah, that would be that would be ridiculous. Yeah, this game has the potential for some like Wake Forest last year vibe to it. I know they gave up 27, but I fell a lot of that was sort of like, oh, yeah that cups in the third quarter like terms of the discomfort that they felt defensively early on. I mean, maybe John passes most similar to that Newman guy that that Wake Forest put in is a huge looking at night and was effective running the ball. Just I bring up Wake Forest. They had 40 Notre Dame had 40",bee
2875," I doubt that they're going to be getting off sure. Nobody would look good. The team's yes, of course.",ant
2876, Ocean there. The purple reward is not as great to them or as frequent as the risk.,ant
2877," Great series from mid-june. Here's how I had the receivers rated USC One Michigan to we know both of them have a have a competent quarterback, Virginia Tech 3. The only guy that they lost was there Akuma, they had trouble with Hazleton lemon years of to the end of quarters and their quarterback is back and getting better for we had we had Notre Dame on their list after that we had, Virginia.",ant
2878," Yeah, I love the fact that it's the games mean so much. I mean I really like basketball but they games simply don't mean as much to the to anyone because it's okay to lose those games it is it's great that these games matter that much. I don't like the overemphasis on the playoffs. If you're not the playoffs in which we cover you ESPN's kind of ruin that with playoff predictors now like who cares now, you know, you can just enjoy the season but I love everything about",ant

2880," Happen next year he comes back he gets what to more carries a game with one more pass thrown to him. It's not that big of a deal and well, he could lose he could significantly lose carries next right because they'll actually trust other people more right but going for Tony Jones makes note. I mean is the only choice but also there's no way Notre Dame's - Taylor Brian Kelly and the new offensive coordinator are going to lament the loss of Tony Jones because first of all, they don't play with Concept in game one, which he would be like. Oh and he's Tony Jones that game and number two if you can't replace Tony Jones as we hey,",ant

2884," If that was the move, yes, you demoted him the offense got better. Yeah, he did threat here. Let's let's clarify and I saw that I saw Eric Hanson said that in his story and and that was something we are aware of he didn't get fired from Notre Dame. He was asked not to be the play caller anyway, so it's totally cute and that's a positive step in the offense. Right right demoted. Yeah, right and and he made that choice in mark",ant

He has some Force positions on tight end surfaces where he's really looked clean and as good as we've had it's getting comfortable and technique and repetition at some things are a little more challenging for him.

2899," One total kick return touchdowns by power 5 teams last year 21 total over every game that was played torian's Notre Dame. So people remember that kick return is being legislated out of the game Notre Dame just has to not give up kick returns and maybe break one against Georgia would be nice. But other than that, I think you know, maybe not Michael Young and kick return if they love Lawrence keys because he's a young guy that could if Young's a full-time starter, yeah, and then for punt returns we have not seen.",bee
2900," When he was thrown in cold, I mean I think you know, I think he's always been technique challenged. He's a he's a much bigger corner. So I think that that is a challenge for him, but there's no doubt the accumulation of injuries and I don't remember him as well. As you do that. That's a that's a great I'll you know what I could really love Dante Vaughn's tape coming in and I had them highly ranked and then as a freshman on a terrible team, he made some plays he started three games. You got to pick in the end zone against Duke and that sounds funny, but it was important. I mean, he was almost yeah.",ant
2901," I want to ask Clark a lie about a hundred Spears. I kind of knew how he was going to answer when you ask that coordinator about injuries. He's not really exceeds say yeah, he is seeds to Brian Kelly. So and I'm not sure Saturday is the right time to ask but I'm going to we're going to hell we have yeah, we need to we could because we need to know about him and and Jimmy on Franklin and I mean, my sense is a hundred Spears is closer because of the severity of Jamie. I'm Franklin's injury, but I don't know.",ant
2902," Claypool I gotta go Claypool. He's I think you know yards and tucked. Yeah, I think you know over the course of 60 Minutes think is going to accumulate catches because it's a safe for all its short bro. You want to get him the ball in space and I think any against Fink on or on Tobar exceptions, but rear yards and touchdown. Oh, yeah. Yeah, right. It's the more of a Down Down field for it and then leading rusher. I think we both agree. It's going to be too far Armstrong see Norman 83 top.",ant
2903," That's the defense. I want to talk about the office now. So I like his future. I'm sure going to I'm not saying I feel like it's right here. So brings all the matters is he's a productive football player. Jacob Lacey is he's a big strong kid that runs all day. I mean II thought his stamina this spring was surprising to me, right b2i. That was my favorite part of it. I think and that was my that was actually that was my question. I had him ranked going into his senior year like I kind of kept a running tally where I had guys ranked. I had them lower and some people",bee
2904," I'm the same about linebackers because I figured they would have something figured out and they do but I don't know. We nobody knows about these linebackers till you see them playing in games and having a fit runs and things now, no doubt. I thought the offensive line would be good. And if they further that you may be even better with Jarrett Patterson and I point that out at Center, I think Jarrett Patterson by the end of the year what they want to do offensively with him on the move. They might be that might he might be a better Center. Yeah, and I think you know, I think he's going to intelligence why he's going to hit the ground.",ant
2905," Poop over who was also really good. Yeah, that's not an accident. They expect huge things from him this year and I think like a Brian Kelly is going to publicly undersell Kyle Hamilton until everyone sees it on National Television when it's Louisville or New Mexico or Georgia. It doesn't matter it and I got that but he was out standing on Sunday and I just have not seen freshman performances like that.",ant
2906," He's somebody that is now consistently I think going to be able to pick up yards on the ground not just broken play or it's a total fake out like, you know, the Northwestern touchdown run. I think he can actually be a little bit of a threat there, but he was better at that before he started remember like we come in against LSU 20 yards. Was it Wake Forest 30 yards up the middle 40 yards up the middle then I think probably more going on when you're running the read option. Yeah 10 times game physically. Yeah. I think there's a chick.",bee
2907," He's a lot more laser target now and he's just he looks physically really well put together. Whereas last year. I think he was kind of more like in the Jack lamb group where he's kind of on the other size range. We talked about our concern of him moving again to Buck because he's been Rover Buck like, yeah, he did he played there and you know game for what that's worth but there's numbers involved in Camp to we he could easily be a backup Mike and practice number four of their five that we go to you.",ant

Yeah, I wrote I wrote that in karbala get on the first day with he was probably so nervous out there that I mean, I would I would have met I would imagine so I mean, you know, I don't know that he pays any attention to the media sitting up in the stands, but there's enough pressure from there's no nausea from Chip long to begin with bounce the ball in Tempo drill, you know, just like it's 11:00 or yeah. It's 11:00 on are you're never supposed to miss the throw in tempo?",ant
2909," Were most of those points were unreturnable. None of them were 50 45 plus like Newsom did accidentally. Yeah, you know, they're all in between the 30s, but I think that was by Design so is as critical as I've been a j Bramblett, I thought he did a hell of a job yesterday in the first practice of the preseason. I also thought you know when I when I looked at the corners, I still thought ago row.",ant
2910, Going to rip on somebody but if you have a back injury that hurts you for your second year and a neck injury when you get in August of your second year and a broken hand you're playing with last year and you kind of quit on plays against Pittsburgh and you have the shoulder and their shoulder they all take a toll right? So it'd be a it's a little bit different because Crawford's injuries are so famous and debilitating. He's had as many interesting properties. So I would love to see Dante Von have a starter year. I like Dante Von coming out. I like don't even as a freshman I think.,ant
2911," Thought he would be yes because I didn't think he would be a factor at all. That's like Tony Jones when he was a redshirt freshman and he had the really good spring practices in the really good August camp, but now let's say that right now and the fans don't like that as much because they don't like Tony Jones anymore because he's a senior that hasn't been great, right? Yeah. You made a comment. It was a 227. Yeah, he carries that way really really Tony Jones were dear - he does not look like the chubby running back that you've seen out there in the past. No, so hopefully just good. It is a senior running back. Hopefully that translates so you don't have to answer to making",ant
2912," Is Step number one for him? And he doesn't have that down yet. So he's got a he's got a long way to go singles. What do you think of this possible Nick alignment pride and Crawford at boundary and field Elliot nickel Gilman and Hamilton at safety. I think with the three safeties as exactly what the coach except wants it to be. Yeah, and I think that had something to do with Crawford playing some safety yesterday. I know that's not the exact alignment that sickles is you'll have a proposing Crampton out. You totally sure they couldn't even try to do this yesterday.",ant
2913, Back and see if it works out two things one providing protects a football and never fumbles in a practice scenario. So you have confidence in him. Yeah. I really think the bigger problem is that Brian Poland's kick return team is too damn inconsistent and it Michael Young. It's what it's what happens inside the 20-yard line that determines I will say though you and I last year would watch games and we thought he is not aggressive enough right now returning the kicks. I agree with that. You're right. You're right.,bee
2914," Or receivers they just like they redshirted more than they usually do last year. So that sort of creates a backlog. That means they they can again red shirt quite a bit this year. I think they all red shirt more this year than last year and more than any other Kelly Arab Ed because they're getting used to this four-game rule. Like when Carol will probably get the Jerry Patterson treatment that he gets to play two games in a blowout cigarette because you know, you have to mean yeah, if he's a good player why not the other three won't play will cross get to play in a game or two process.",bee
2915,"Book that we kind of remembered from the past and our team also loses a great defensive end tremendous defensive performance night or excuse me, eight three and outs and as important six more drives where Duke didn't gain 25 yards. That's just no chance you lose a game. I think really plays that we suspected that it could be that type of beat down for Dukes offense, but nor name took it to another level. Yeah. I thought the defense was excellent. They had what I think seven three and outs and they are likely to the one out. Okay. Yeah.",bee
2916," are not being productive and it coincides with the offensive line, but I running backs are not being productive enough. I trust in book to keep the ball a little bit more. I just think he's banged up now. I mean, he's got a shoulder now he was wincing, you know after that 45-yard run head throw a while. Yeah, you know, it's interesting and I kind of just speculate. Well, how do you deal with that? I mean and Hasselbeck the analyst for the game said, you know, you're going to feel that tomorrow more than you do today. And I think anybody that's",ant
2917, A key member of this so I career Jones is not coming off the field right? You're on Jones did want to be on it.,ant
2918," Pretty good job, right? Yeah, I guess but I mean I the reason I have just because I think we all would have based upon the reputation that he had 14 and a half is not a whole lot of the only had four in nine games this year. That's the reputation half. Is this question is is there no doubt. No doubt psycho. 3838 was the emphasis on the in book Running more part of the game plan for Duke what was known and doing differently or was it Duke doing something differently than a lot of well, it's you know, it's man coverage when the opponent runs a lot of man.",ant

He's he was kind of he's the breaking point between yay or nay judge Arthur vandelay putting in books - passing stats against Duke aside. What did you see from him that makes you more confident in him as nor names quarterback the rest of the season IE stepping up in the pocket going through his progressions, etc. Those things. Yeah.",ant
2920," Once One Snap too many maybe he just you know, I just think that his his technique is just all over the place. He's lunging all over the place and size and physicality can only give you so much Andy NYC the announcers for the Duke game were saying that freak is finally healthy. I hadn't heard he was hurt. Did they keep that under wraps? And is that why his production was off before this game? And again, I will say Indian why see if",bee

I wasn't around when Shawn Crawford was speaking post Virginia Tech and he apparently reference it wasn't us. It was a it was a to it was on a don't misspeak. It was on a podcast that has nothing to do with any of the outlets that are normally he got maybe it has something to do with the award. He received for a comeback player of the week. And oh, yeah.",ant
2922," I was waiting for some time that counts 2017 Notre Dame only won that game because they decided Josh Adams cannot be tackled and we're going to run the ball down our throat and come back and win in the second half. Yeah, that was like Josh Adams laboring end of the year. He was hurt. I think when also when Bush was right behind us, I think I would pass this keep to but that's why the Navy has always been a touchdown. But then if you don't run, it's like there's their Navy they're small and you why aren't you pounding them? He should not listen to that.",ant
2923," I need to sit down be like what did we do these two weeks to come out and lay that big of an egg and it to be it as a lot less to do with like well, we shouldn't have run that slow developing play on nothing to do with their life had nothing we play Too Deep safeties in a rainstorm. And now it's it's everything leading up to that game that that's they're going to have to really be forensic about picking that thing apart and I just to clarify do I think that Nora is going to go out and win a National Title?",ant

It's you know, a Minnesota if you lose that game, it's like man, you played a great game. You just came up short to an undefeated Penn State and scrape point the whole world changes at the University of Notre Dame where look as soon as Brian Kelly wants 10 games.",ant
2925, So I mean the previous drive was 17 place and that was a crazy trying to nothing out of it as well and they should have because IAM book missed call combat wide open in the end zone for the for the second time in the game. You know nor Dame had 447 yards total offense to Virginia Tech's 240. They were in 91 plays to the Hokey 64. So it was 64 and our name was the better football team most of the game but,ant
2926," our average, you know, they're not great at that position, but it's not done abysmal either and I think it's sort of been portrayed that way on social media message boards. Yeah, and I and and by me at times to certainly because because because I expected Troy Pride to be more of a playmaker. I'm sure he's just he's not totally give you that. I mean, it's been it's been disappointing based on what I thought it would be and what I think we all thought it would be an August but I wouldn't say no rain has a problem that corner, right?",ant

It's kind of a give and take from one week to the next and so I wonder how they'll play against Notre Dame and I like quarterbacks play against Virginia Tech mm. You seem like you could control I mean they have Deon Jackson was a running back their name really like to recruiting. Yes, not much of a jump past thrower at the goal line. If you saw the way their game against North Carolina, and it really one of the worst",ant

I mean that's kind of a perpetually one of those perpetually underrated guys, you know, so when National me to put out their top 20 coaches David cutcliffe almost never on right now should be like kind of like Bill Snyder at Kansas State Clausen. Yeah. I just yeah, they've got it Carson to weight Force, you know, it's never winning to the point where like, oh my God.

He won't throw it the perfect example for me in this game and they're all there's an example in every game at least one First and Ten from the 17. This is probably just prior to the Armstrong fumble. He's rolling to his right Chris Fink is rolling that way. It's an easy pitch and catch for seven eight yards. Maybe so second and three at the 10,bee

Yeah, I don't think that physical therapist but the number of passes in this particular game was dictated by the circumstances. Yeah, it's if they threw ten passes this week or 90 passes as week.

I mean it looked like if Armstrong and Fink the first play of the game of Who-ville. So yeah, I think I did I didn't think",ant
3030," Yeah, they're inefficient in the first quarter. Let's say 250 for would you have 52 at the same as Chuck freebie 52:13 on our pregame show I had 63 and they went over that ice. Wow, and the band 94. What do you see that Notre Dame needs to do to solidify the rush defense against what should be the best offensive line running backs. They should face all year. I will remove the two chud's or him right now, Georgia appears to be more run right at you than option. Would that make it easier for the defense to prepare?",ant
3031," Why is Chris Simms saying three or four times during a broadcast there? It's a great offensive. It's a great offensive a great offensive line and they're coached really really well. What are you basing that upon or are you just doing like a lot of other people and just saying words because that's all those are damn words. That's all that is there. Not a great offensive line right now. You can't say that they are no one what one can look through still meeting, but he said pregame so he can't he came out of the Louisville game and he I would agree and they know they did they were good against",ant

That's you know, now three games into it and has done some good things. Now, you have three good safeties and to good Corners, right? Right. Yes, so you're going to mean every everybody on a defense has to play one of the best games I've ever played Terry Benedict two games into the season.",ant
3033," It shows opening 10 and a half right now and covers but that means the summer because if you really start clicking on things it shows June 24th or something like that. So I think it started at 13 and 1/2, which is great because you're going to get a lot of people betting both ways. Every Notre Dame fan of the world thinks they can stay close to that and people that don't respect their name think that's a two-touchdown win and pretty easy. I let so what if it's 14 and a half that's probably the best place to put the hats or and that's what I'm thinking. That's what I'm thinking. Yeah. It's I would go under two touchdowns, but certainly over double digits.",ant

It's the last thing from your mind, especially with guys that haven't started it haven't really played. So it's understandable. It's fine. You're working on the fundamentals. At least he threw out a couple names that we can cling to a little bit and say, okay those guys make sense as potential FrontRunner it to to inside position on the other side of the ball. He I think Tony Jones was probably brain Kelly's highlight think that they're getting consistency out of their senior Runner. I also",ant
3036," When I look at the constants nickel playing out there. I just look I love Sean Crawford. And if Sean conference healthy, he's the best cover nickel they will have but Kyle Hamilton if he can play the way we think and the way the coaches think he can hold out here having a big safety there. This is way too soon because jhamora Slaughter was a senior but when they're more of Slaughter was a senior in 2011, he was a really good modern vehicle when he was healthy and they haven't had that since now does he have the side to side quickness of Sean Crawford or at least a healthy son Crawford? Probably not the yes Such Great Lengths. Yeah.",ant

No, it's not couldn't get an answer to save our lives. But because he was no it's not a situation like that it and it comes down to traits and Troy jr. Came in and imitated Brian Kelly briefly. You did a good job mention traits naturally, but processing traits, you know, and it can look Kevin Austin can turn this around in a week. That's right, and that's why would early you can turn around.",bee

But yeah, well, you know Jonathan door is he's got a lot of proof and I thought he responded well in the Navy game when he missed his first extra point and he kicked his own we feel go.

There's no doubt about that Tavon Coney drue tranquill. And whoever you want to put it Rover would not have been freely running around making those plays without a Notre Dame's defensive line last year.

Now you got and of course the linebackers that goes without saying because it's so devoid of playing experience but old lines more realistic to me. Yeah, absolutely. Plus I think the offensive",ant

Well your if you that fans have to be able to think critically once in a while you got I know it was one game but Oklahoma only lost one game, you know, there's really an Oklahoma could have lost to Army people like to point that out Ohio State could have lost a Maryland Notre Dame could have lost to Vanderbilt whatever they didn't that's the difference right?

Hey, Kareem got hurt and came back in the game. But it's crazy. How about that? It was I mean, I think you get to that recruiting point it felt to me. It felt a lot like the reverse of the Cotton Bowl last year worst. I thought where you work out don't dream Clemson and yeah, you can say eight or nine plays and technically, I guess that's true. But like",ant

So what you did is you have the defensive lines at the biggest Advantage for causing fumbles and causing chaos. Then you have guys look for the football and the pretty good at it. I agree normally like hey, they could start like 2002 they force whatever 500 turnovers and then 2003 with nine guys back. They forced 12. That's it. So that's a little weird. But the way they play on that defensive line and the way some of those secondary guys go after the ball. It's no wonder they were able to pour somebody terms this year any of book.",ant

I agree. But you know, you do have to and Matt Campbell was talking about what this team. You do have to kind of reconfigure the leadership of this team and what colleague Curry meant to the defense and what Chase Claypool meant to the offense and what a low-key Gilman meant to the defense and Bill nelia to you very very very much.

I know you can't put everybody out there because some freshmen are just all of a sudden getting buried and they can't they don't want to go talk to the media and I don't blame them for cutting. I think they give us good access those first two weeks. It's like four or five open practices. I don't blame for cutting it off. Once you hit to your I mean, they're prepping for Michigan. You really need to have the right sitting in there watching you do that anymore after to we use two weeks and I would do it that what coaches do and I would close practice and season. Yeah.",ant

Now, I'm of the I'm completely of the mindset that Jeff Armstrong is going to stand out this spring. There's no doubt that he's going to be the starting running back. That's that's my perspective on Jeff Armstrong as the player and the person the person that we know at least up to this point and I didn't include any of the freshmen like lacy that are very important because they have miles to go still in the summer in August before they can view it.

This isn't you know, this whole Romance of Joe Montana was a bad practice quarterback, but in the game he first of all the game was incredibly different than where it was just line up and play.

I know a lot of people are disappointed that Shane Simon has moved to inside linebacker. First of bucket. Looks like he's working it and at Mike now but you know because he was the quote prototypical Rover but a year before woo-suk or MOA was the quote prototypical Rover so,ant

3302," Want to talk a little bit about that, but well we let's start with the the national championship game. We don't want to get too deep into this because it's already becoming ancient history in in our world, but I thought Alabama would win to say that I'm shocked that Clemson followed through with a with the season that they did. I mean, I don't know that I'm shocked by that because they were really really good. They were the best team. They were the most dominant team. They were the most deserving team. I thought Alabama would win going to the game because I thought the one chance",ant
3303," Clear now. Clearly there's for more than seven points in this. Yeah, that's exactly yeah. I just thought after the Notre Dame game that Notre Dame is below Clemson, Alabama and that Notre Dame played a bad game and at Clemson is better than Notre Dame for sure and played a good game and I thought it was that simple Notre Dame is not as good as Clemson and played badly offensively Clemson is better than Notre Dame and played well and that's all I took from that game.

I think there are many excellent position coaches at the running back position Notre Dame needs to have an excellent position coach and an excellent recruiter at running back. And right now I think they just have a excellent position Coach K Beasley. Why does the recency bias seem to apply to an ordained Bama loss the Clemson by more than ND did was appoint Oklahoma got clobbered it. He didn't write that I said,",ant
3308," It family-friendly good pay. I mean, I don't think the buyout has a whole lot to do with it. Just make sure your coordinators are well compensated. Look Tennessee just hired George's offense coordinator on a three-year deal worth 1.5 million dollars per year, which is insane but there's no reason Clark Lee and Chip long shouldn't be making 1 1 1 2 1 3 after last season.

You don't want to lose the Georgia and like week 5 right that don't want 2013 where you have your second lost by the end of September you want you want to unfortunately, I have a reason to watch the first playoff rankings show on ESPN.

Yes, just like in a backup capacity, you know when we go out to practice as I mean, we've the first scrimmage format is the same as it's always been",ant
3312," Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean they're still optimistic about where Kevin Austin's going like this isn't this isn't like a stuff Orson Dexter William. No choice you are like, oh this guy's not really getting with the program. He said he played in the bowl. So I mean they don't that would have been a bad sign can water about can Lawrence Keys be a game wrecker. Maybe not as a rookie, right? Yeah means I wouldn't think it'd be like this. I understand the question, but to to answer to even like really discuss it on the offensive side of the ball.",ant

Oh, I mean I just I you know, you said that you know that you can replace receivers. I get it compared to the defensive ends. It's my main thing. Yeah, great and then there are receivers in there go two receivers and he absolutely was a go to receiver. His hands were tremendous back shoulder throw, you know the gullible guy when you needed when you needed a",ant
3315," Yeah, I mean, I think that on Saturday Chris think wasn't there and lie, Michael Berg wasn't there yet. So it was harder to protect and harder to get open but I did think you know on Thursday Kevin Austin was out of this world. I'm coming on Saturday coming off soon, which is good. I thought that Brayden Lindsay in some ways was more impressive on Saturday that he was on Thursday. Maybe I'm just sort of like hyper interested in his ability to actually hit somebody but like he was physical.",ant
3316," Like a physical if anything it's is one thing but our played 13 games on specialty last year. So he's Adept at doing that but go for retweeted probably at Notre Dame. Yes, I did somebody I said is this the little the rep Tim was talking about mean amazing? No, no. No. No, this was just another really good rep. He had a Vibe. I eat a violent streak in that where everyone's jumping. It was fun to watch and hear others talk about them. I mean, they really like them going forward and Joy Bryant pullings reaction behind gufu on that route and see what it's like.",ant
3317," I don't know if he's the best guy at any of the three positions but he's the most experienced really at all of them. So it's still it's difficult for me to see as marble and not in the starting lineup for that reason, but I agree with you, but that's not ideally reason. No, it's not. I mean, I think ideally they would have guys that are perfect fits for each of those three positions, you know, whether that's Simon and or lamb at Bach whether that's a succour, MOA and Malala are over at Mike. I think it might have been more like a Drew Wyatt.",ant
3318," I call him at the season if you're Jalen Elliott on Saturdays, but yeah, I mean come it looks like the guy that the coaches thought he was always going to be when this soon as he showed. Yeah, I guess we can talk my I think we have a Tommy tremble question the second segment we can talk more about the tight ends are so that segment one back with burning up the boards and segment two.",ant
3319, Stories around the 1990 recruiting class which McDougal was a part of and multiple players that group births and Aaron Taylor and particular said they were actually going to go to Lou Holtz and say you're making mistakes starting Rob paulus. Kevin would rule is the guy. This is the guy we want to start and then like a day or two later. I was broke his collarbone and never had a meeting. So it's like it's kind of one of the things like the freak out what it sounds like it was quite palpable if you were here at the down here.,bee
3320," Right. Now you can play he can play. Yeah, which makes it difficult. Now the key of course is the for game. The key is the four-game Redshirt Junior Jones cannot be lost to not only the team but I mention it again play four games in his mind. He can be part of a successful season and come back and killing for a starting role next year. That's much better than saying. Hey, we're going to put you on the Shelf. You don't want to be on the Shelf as a senior with your teammates. I mean, it's the opposite of how freshmen are used with the four-game rule where like if you're an incoming guy. That's it.",ant

3322," I mean if we state that we if acquire creamer healthy then it's going to be hard for opening day. J22. Yeah, because I like to make that kind of a jump but we like him a lot. I think Houston Griffith is flashed enough that I'm like that I think you might have a good season but I think the guy that could improve the most because like look day literally went from playing.",ant
3323," Want to play them though, you know if they want else to would most definitely wants their he just don't think they're going to be able to do it. I don't maybe Franklin like in the second half but I think there's something I don't know sure. I'm going to hold out on Howard cross. I know this the the frame doesn't say I think you offensive tackle you and I like Spears more than Pete, but I think we can all agree on this towards ACL in November and he's a big defensive tackle that came to a college program that is not going to be able to do anything for real to make himself better.",ant
3324," Developmental Football this isn't like, you know, you're coming from Georgia or Virginia or Ohio or California. So amazed it's erect up dude, but I like a lot of other running backs. I mean just just personal preference. I like at least five other running backs on their list including Chris Tyree. Yeah, and you Tom McClean who's a similar type back I there's at least five guys. I like better than Tyreke Murphy. I'm told.",ant
3325, And it was that bad they all see every they were fortunate to win nine games. I couldn't believe it it definitely Icees. I mean like the offseason was impossible.,ant
3326," What he does is that he creates room space for himself and then is able to make shorter easy throws on the Run. He's not very good for running the football going to his left. But when he gets out of the pocket, he's very elusive within the pocket. He creates some passing situation. But Florida State's plan of pushing him left was working great for two and a half quarters and then stop pushing left a little bit of money to start making plays, you know after watching Jake from I'm starting to want Notre Dame to face the athlete playing quarterback that can kind of throw.",ant
3327," Why you can't if you can come out with if you can come out with with a set of place to begin with not that you have to necessarily go back to those but you can give them the same look and do a variation off that or you can go back to some of those place. I know easier said than done but the bog down, you know, nine plays 19 yards in the third quarter bogged down. It allowed George has come back and play. I do want to mention a few of the Virginia players because their names will come up because they're so aggressive. They have a six-foot seven 235 pounds outside linebacker Charles Snowden number.",bee
3328," There are little erratic there. But Joe reads a guy to keep an eye on in the kick return game. And one thing I like to point out in these situations since if you're not at the game, it's easier to watch the perimeter. Obviously Bryce Hall plays the boundary. It's but against Florida State. He did say I asked Jamie Oaks. He was moving around. So he's going to be rocking chair leg Lariat Beyonce's Claypool, even if they pull moves around but with Nick Grant coming out of the field spot. That's a that's an interesting matchup for Lawrence keys or Michael Young. Yes. We want to get on to get thing.",ant
3329," This is give a chance to win is Georgia. Well and Khalid Kareem believes that they are ready to win out based upon his good strong comments could hopefully they'll explain to him that you got to win this one hours course. Oh, of course, of course TK browse the situation was much different then but the Irish lost a bidding war for the services of my calcio not saying Clark lie or chip long would do it. But at this point would it be completely unacceptable for the Irish to be outbid for them other than for a head coaching opportunity. First of all, I don't think Clark Lee or tip Longwood.",ant
3330," Capable of getting away from Virginia. Secondary Nick Grant Bryce hall because they're they really good in coverage. Tommy tremble is a tough guy to cover when you have commitment Claypool on the field. So I just think what he brings myth Michael. I don't expect Michael. Don't be hit the ground running like Cole connected this week. So I think Tommy tremble this week is an important piece of like two three catches not the one that was a beautiful play by the way, the Tommy tremble the the fourth quarter. Yeah, and then right and then book on first down makes the bad decision on the interception. I actually agree with",bee
3331," Say much better on the responsibilities that New Mexico. I mean in Mexico's you're not here is not as locked in either the amount of film they watch on their own against New Mexico probably less than they had. Yeah of whatever television they watch that weak Euro, you know, so I'm not sure how much they are there watching Georgia film. I'm sure they are preparing for George on their bye week. I'm sure continued a little bit and they want to buy a hundred fifty points. So it's not that big a deal but I do think that also look better because they won't be subbing in linebackers as much as they did against New Mexico in Louisville. They've settled it. Yeah. I think they have",ant

Yeah, they need He's A pounder, you know, I mean, he's just He's A pounder. He's going to run hard and he's going to run physically every time he touches football and that's an asset that everybody needs an or name usually doesn't have that. He's the key I think coming back this week more so than Michael Young even because with commit",ant

3334," Bloods his Virginia place. I don't think so. I don't think so either. Now. Again, Brian Kelly was commended siebel Flowmaster for his past blocking against New Mexico. But this is this is more difficult. This is definitely more difficult. And I think when all is said and done, I think it depends on maybe how much snorting Pros I don't necessarily know. He's not going to throw. I mean if he has to be well, but I don't think he's gonna for a 47 times again. I'm not I don't think he probably feels 40 don't think he throws for to either how it was enough plays in this game offensively to throw for probably true away. Yeah.",ant
3335," Fancies for Notre Dame in this game and people will call it not being ready to play but just I think the thing is got a good day. Can we can we all keep that in mind that it may you know, there may be some struggle here and it's not the over/under is what you should be looking it's not because the coaching staff sucks as people like to jump on. Okay, that's enough. We will be a by prediction. Oh my gosh, I even start my prediction will be on Friday. I think it's going to end up being fairly similar to Tim O'Malley's.",ant
3336," It's past that and then we're sitting in Springs last practice and they are coaching the hell out of to quote Timber Easter hematopoietic or oh there's a reason for that. Yeah. He's the guy that they were rolled. Yeah, they were I mean, they're playing different positions. But still we know the no Boykin was certainly capable of playing feet field corner back, you know, I thought it was worth the gamble. I didn't like the gamble when I thought that they were going to shut out DJ Brown from getting a scholarship because I always felt like",ant

I know there's a lot of talk about Tillery had he stayed in offensive tackle be a top five pick. I think that's easy to throw out there and say and I get it because I think he would have been a really outstanding left offensive tackle. That means I'll take that guy the end of the first round. Well guess that athletic ability make room. I guess I just kind of remain skeptical about whether I mean, I know Gabriel has his ear to the ground and if",ant

I never really got to that question because that was kind of what those things were. His belief is that I don't know if Tom Reiss gives them the best chance without question to win the game, but it certainly gives Brian Kelly the best read on Tom Reiss as a play caller, which is ultimately I think Notre Dame",ant

I think in the last podcast that they can morph into different things with that that second run of Defense where you have safety like players there that can drop back into coverage or can come up and support the run.

Don't tell me don't tell me that you know that this is a good football team. If they lost five games. Well, they lost by a point on two-point conversion where brought Purdy had a guy open and through to the wrong man, and they would have converted it. They lost on a field goal, Iowa 20 seconds to go. They lost don't feel good at Baylor with under five minutes to go. They're that close now. I'm a big believer.",ant

But I think if you have a a were going to throw it type of past game, you'll put up some big numbers. Yeah, Troy Pride. He doesn't make plays. Yeah. He doesn't make plays in this is a good enough receiving Corps to give them trouble. I agree with what you're saying about the level of quarterback than our team has played.",ant
3450, Women cream and claypole. I mean there was really no doubt. Kareem actually came out and said there was absolutely no doubt that it was good enough for Quentin Nelson and Mike mcglinchey. It's good enough for him. So that was the initial feeling that okay. Well if those guys are going to play they're going to be ready to play but we'll find out I don't we're beating a dead horse sir.

Oh see that's what I would do if I was him and if he does named Rhys I think you'll be cold see with Lance Taylor. No I'm saying I know I know you're saying that but your you think that if he stays in house, I think those two will be co-coordinators. Yes. I just don't think he'll stay in house.

This is the least important part of that game, but it is telling they had nine new guys siebel flow start the game, you know, and I'll do blockers Dave on McKinley was blocking. He hadn't played in two years. It was like obviously they're not taking this that seriously and he looked like he hadn't played in two years when he was trying to block because you know, the other team does have feet by being so much better than a team.

I really like about him is there's several plays where he otherwise would have made contact behind the line of scrimmage, but he makes a very very",ant

I just don't think that repeats with Antonio Brown.",ant
4524, Be excellent for the wide receiver 40 price. That's this. That's incredible. It's people I think people are also getting caught in the the dynasty mindset where you see that he's 31 years old and you kind of expect this drop-off but his style of play isn't one where it requires him to beat people with speed. He's a technician and he's a great route Runner and that's that's where he excels and he's going to continue to do that. I just think,bee
4525," Burner, then you have Chad Williams who still on the roster? I don't think that Chad is going to be really that relevant. So I think that he could beat out Katt Williams Hakeem Butler. Now Hakeem has intangibles. He's a I mean, I think Kevin y63 and Hakeem is like six-six. He's a total now. He's had problems.

He's got guys in the backfield that have done things Jordan Howard again in that same murky backfield. So those are the guys that you're looking at that are that are being drafted in front of him.

Yeah, it's like that Bell is a huge but bus candidate for me. There's no way that led Bell is going to finish this season in my mind. There's no way that he finishes as our everyone.

I understand that but I don't think he's that fast. I don't think he's worth that you talked about his athleticism can develop.

4633, Target's he only had one catch so very inefficient when he's getting high volume. Not really sure what's going on there. I obviously or I honestly haven't been able to sit down and watch those games as far as his efficiency. But you see that the Vikings have made a shift to a more run-heavy offense.

He actually had the most receptions of any of the guys that were talking about today and which is to me is a little bit surprising but like the Steelers quarterback situation I think is well held him back the most and and seeing you big been paired with him is totally worth getting excited about I really like him a lot moving forward my ballpark range for him. I think.,ant

He was he was doing well and then all of a sudden he had some soreness and they did a little bit of procedure in there.

I don't really like starting wide receivers in the",bee
4660," Me as far as projecting the Bears offense that's difficult is the way that Matt Nagy uses. All of the players is so random and it's you're never sure which guys going to pop off. So that's what keeps me hesitant on the Bears. I believe in the talent of the LA a lot of the guys but and as happens when you have some some offensive coordinators that are good at NFL offensive coordinator, but don't care at all about your fantasy team. They're going to they're going to game plan and the game plan is going to be different each.",ant

And yeah, it's a great great offense to Great to really good offenses verse 2 really good defense has and so it's going to be a pretty exciting game and it's it'll it'll show us a lot about what their season is going to look like if one of them comes out soon.",ant
4662, the best back that they have and so I expect them to feed Aaron Jones the ball and we'll see how he does that I'm obviously most excited to see Anthony Miller. That's that's like not even a question but the guy that I'm really most interested to see outside of Anthony Miller is Michener Biscay because I want to see if he can throw the ball left this year.

If you remember he finished a season I would like in the wide receiver 6 range back in 2014. So the potential there is this the ceiling there is really high and so that's why you hold on to them.

4673, strong but I'm I'm questioning the sustainability of 18 yards per reception and wondering if this is going to be who he is if he's going to become this deep threat guy that that actually has a decently High catch percentage or if you're going to see him kind of come back down to where he was and not be as efficient because it's been it's been such he's been so,ant

4675," No, that's a no. You still wouldn't it step out? No. No, I'm not hit. They're going to tell draft a guy. I don't have any doubt about that. Yeah, they have to move on from our own Jones. The the offense is too explosive and Ronald Jones does not making the cut. He's not he's not pass blocking the way Bruce Arians wants me to block, you know, as a runner. He's improved a little bit but again like not special enough to keep on the field, so",ant

I ended up trading him for Josh Allen because I needed a quarterback that would be viable most weeks and is as much as I don't like Josh Allen as a player his rushing up side gives them some more fantasy relevance, so,",ant

And so yeah like",ant

He's unable to separate. He's great with the with the ball in his hands, but you can't get the ball in his hands easily. He's got to you've got to manufacture ways to get the ball into his hands. So that's that's my thought on the Keel Harry not super high on him moving forward, especially with a lot in flux.",ant
4696," In from nikhil Harry so far and I know it's going to be a developmental guy. So if I'm going to take a gamble, it's like alright. Well, we'll one in the hand verse 2 in the bush or whatever. Like I'll take I'll take the ones in the bush. I'll take the the unknown because they have just as good of a chance as new kill Harry at this point because of like we just haven't seen anything good from him. So like",ant
4697," But I am excited about him and his development moving forward. He's pretty good route Runner. He's got strong hands. I think as a as a Niners fan having watched every game the one area you're expecting him to improve a little bit just his consistency with his hands. He'll drop like really easy passes every once in awhile, but that will continue to improve. So for a lot of these guys confidence is the big thing and debose starting to click a little bit. So another offseason working with Emmanuel Sanders.",ant
4698," And really did most of his damage in the second half of the season and it's like he's kind of what I would say is maybe an Adam thielen type deal where where he's a great route Runner. He's a physical specimen. So he's even bigger than Adam thielen, but all it took was him getting a chance with some volume and you see just explosion. And so now I mean it's too late to to buy low mid season was your time to buy but he's got to be the wide receiver one.",ant

How many points is he going to be differentiated between a fifth or sixth round quarterback? Oh, yeah, that's what he's talking about. So if it's if it's four points",ant
4703," Let's let's go into a little bit of so real quick on the other the important thing here to recognize is if you have a top-10 quarterback and a ten-team league, it does not matter if your quarterback is nine or eight or ten that and and you drafted him in the fifth round. That was a total waste. So you cannot miss on your quarterback. If you take him in the top half of the draft there's a lot of room for error to because there's a lot of room for error there there. It's such a fluctuating position group, right?",ant

Ooh starting to pick it up a little bit to me that that's such an exciting offense and I think Baker can do whatever he wants in that Freddy kitchens offense. So I'm all aboard the baker Mayfield train. I'll time how I'll happily take him in the sixth round. You point in your flag, man.",bee

I don't think Jared Goff is like that awesome of a quarterback. No, he's like by himself, but he's got Brandon Cooks. He is Robert Woods has Cooper cup, he's got Todd Gurley kind of and now he's got Darryl Anderson, but if weapons were the only thing we took into consideration then",ant
4706," Well, you're looking at you're looking at a tree loaded weapons. Definitely and I think that's that's a reason another reason why you'd want them on top of the fact that he is good and he can run the ball and he's he's a good quarterback in and of himself, but his weapons definitely can Elevate him even more Capac have they stabilized offensive line. So Jason Peters is getting older and he's missed entire Seasons a couple years in a row, it seems like and so they went out and they drafted Andre Dillard with their first-round pick and I was big for",ant

4708," Well, he has a weapons. He has a weapons now do they have the experience now does he have the weapons? Yes, and I think that he's able to connect with some of these guys because he's a very skilled quarterback. I think he'll be able to if anything he's going to at least find somebody that he likes and develop some sort of relationship with them whether that ends up being fit Kirk that's unclear. But I do think that he has enough weapons that he should be able to be getting the ball out all know for sure tomorrow whenever I get",ant
4709," I do think that is less you compare them a little bit to Vic. I think he's less elusive less athletic them Vic. Yeah, absolutely because Vic is the most athletic player we've ever seen at the quarterback position ever in the NFL and column are still extremely talented but I do think that he's a much better passer than Vic and I think that's going to be one of the things that really distinguishes him from other passing or shooting me dual threat quarterback because he actually is very talented at throwing the ball.",ant

So if you look at Lamar Jackson's seven starts in 2018, he was 18 points 6 points per game, which is actually pretty stellar. That's better than Dak Prescott. That's like in the same ballpark as Russell Wilson and so Lamar super interesting and he didn't even do anything in the passing game. He had like 200 yards throwing",ant
4713," I mean 17 carries game man. That's that's better than a lot of running backs that yeah, it is. He won't see that.

So it's hot but it's not something to scare you away from Devon.",ant
4725," Out Anthony Miller. No, that was too much of a layup then so I decided to get Anthony Miller today. I figure you I mean if you've listened to the show, literally ever, you know, that Anthony Miller is going to break out this year. So I switched it up and we're going to go away from the obvious Anthony Miller break out and I mean, I have a couple guys. Well, we're I'm gonna go Sterling Shepherd and I think he's gone.",ant

So we have all got famous book that we've selected for a player and we're going to tell you why it is that players autobiography and why you should you know, why that player fits along with that book?",bee

4729," I mean I obviously felt like I lost the trade at the time and then I am not sure how I feel about it. Now. I do still think I lost a straight pretty badly, but I don't know how badly until really about the end of this next season, but I ain't through this season and then the end wouldn't be working hot goes.",ant
4730," It's one of those things where I know Russia is a good player so that I believe that pick is going to be he tried to play it up to be a MidFirst. It's not MidFirst is gonna be a late first. So second place in the league this look this past year and so it'll definitely be a bottom for pick so definitely but hopefully it will be a bottom for pick. So for me, it's I'm thinking I have a better chance percent chance to have a rb1 in Darwin Thompson, then I am going to have in next year's draft, which I don't know where players are going to be.",ant
4731," I don't think we have the same conceptualization of the word dominate does losing twice in the regular season count as domination been. No, it does not. Okay. Just check it so assets you're actively trying to acquire what what are some assets that you're actively trying to acquire right now rush. I think one and we're going to get into him in a little bit is Chris Godwin. I think that he his price has not fully reached its peak yet.",ant
4732," Thing that costs me like diving cook is like a trade that we've talked about before Dalvin cook for Tiger killer. Would you do that? And if I had Tyreke I probably wouldn't take the Alvin. But if I was giving I wouldn't want to give Delvin either and so that's kind of where you end up there, you know a little bit tricky. You have a long-term question mark with Tire kill, even if even if he does get suspended for four games or whatever long-term you're not really sure where you're going into there. So and",ant
4733," I would probably go tight end receiver and then either running back or quarterback in that fourth round. My thing about quarterback in this league is that it's super flex and there's no trades and as a pick people up off the waiver wire, so I'm just gonna have to be really accurate with my quarterback to off to be pretty safe there. So I think I will be trying to Target tight end towards the second quarterback. Just have so much fluctuation from year to year.",ant
4734," I'm going for high upside for a couple of rounds and then getting some some guys I think could end up being starters that may not be starters towards the end of the draft. So if I can get I mean, I don't know how competitive without competitive these leaves are tarp for me to know how accurate some of the projections are when we look at websites because those are not exactly experts that are doing the drafting that ends up setting these but if I can get somebody like",ant

Yeah, but you don't know English. I don't know any that was really what we're trying to get after. I promise en espanol servant.

So yeah Andrews want a third and her sweat in the first for some reason in my mind. They were within a couple pics of each other but I mean Andrews is the receiving back or receiving receiving tight end Hearst is that is not his play like this nice place now, but my problem with Andrews well, I mean Andrews, I mean he's all time the rookie tight end. He set the all-time Ricky.",ant
4737," Rifle, so the question is whether or not he's going to be able to translate that style of a game into a Rams offense. The thing is with any other offense, I would say no he's gonna suck but it's the ramps and they actually know how to play football. So it's crazy. How about big of an impact that has on his run style. So I think that he could be utilized and if all the hype that we've had around girly is correct. I legit almost messed up girl. He's named by the",ant
4738, You questioning never done that and when you're talking to a bad guy do you burp at no do you like are you is your up scuse me your honor burp it and then me and you it's only in the podcast. It's only in about cats. I've never done it in. I do a lot of public speaking to for tire killed that I think that if he's still going around this. What are you guys thoughts on him? If he's got a four-game suspension assuming he's going to appeal still do you want him and every draft is that someone you're even interested in? Are you worried that his missing time is going to,ant
4739, to be tough to take them too early. And here's the thing though the thing that you can I can guarantee you no matter what is that he has to appeal this from a legal obligation like unless he comes to some sort of agreement to where it's going to be lesser games. He has to appeal because otherwise it looks like he's guilty. So with that in mind you can at least Bank on that. So I feel like that can give you some sort of feelings of security. So one more name. I've got two more.,ant

But this is still Matt Stafford steam, right and and they'll have to throw the ball that again their defense has anything special. All right. So can you all they will get playing looks this is Kenny Gala day phased out pro bowler Golden Tate. He erased him, right? They traded him because they believed in can go all day. So, you know,",ant
4742," Doing pretty well and that area like Jay colors another example where he receiving our totals but had you know, phenomenal Brandon Marshall those kinds of receivers. And so the the big question mark is the shoulder. I'm not too concerned about Cam and I don't care about accuracy for Fantasy. The concern is camps Health. Can you stay on the field that will change things a lot for them DJ more again at 26? I think that's a great value you getting a wide receiver.",ant
4743," He was pretty successful while a generator is still there, though. He was yeah, he had he had good games with AJ Green there. He was better than Allen Robinson last season and I think a large but I don't think necessarily the Tyler Boyd's a better wide receiver just in and of himself, but the offense that the bears run I don't think his I don't think you're going to see Alan Robinson being great. I own him and I could like rarely play him last year.",ant

You're like, ah, this is gross and stanky, but then obey a little just a little bit of investment little bit of magic and all of a sudden you're grown something worthwhile.

But you shared a template with me of a spreadsheet and that kind of had some offseason goals. It had a list of your players with their age and position and contract situation and it was really really helpful for me.",ant
4751, Rules of what you're trying to do and then looking at your roster with those goals in mind ranking the goals. So if my number one is I don't have a number one running back. My goal is to go out and get a guy that I can plug in as my rb1 for a couple of years get a great Dynasty running back. That was one of mine last year went out and got Zeke. And so that was that was big for me. I got them at a pretty decent discount and so he pulled that trade-off. I'm yeah that one that one ended up I,ant
4752, Ja he kind of came out of nowhere. He was really inconsistent and but someone's willing to pay a premium for him kind of reminds me of like a Derrick Henry. Someone's going to be willing to pay a premium for Derrick Henry and you can get multiple good assets. And so but when I got those assets my intent the entire time was not to keep them they were not building blocks for me. My intent was always to flip them after they had production. So that was kind of what I had in mind there another one that I did actually,ant
4753," But I think that Eddie Isabella could be a wide receiver to this year. So that means that I am not only am I making it equal trade for any Isabella for Cooper cup. I'm getting one of the other whatever other assets along so I'm obviously getting Darwin Thompson, but I'm also getting that draft cat. So that'd be like a situation where that you would be able to make some value out of a combination and inverse combination trade.",ant

No not in terms of actual value, I think say Quan is as Elite as it's going to get CMC is just your next best thing, right? Yeah, I agree say that. Come on like yes, he is next week's best thing but I still would put them in the same tier as far as phase the output.",ant
4765, Take one of my favorite running backs in the NFL and that's Joe Mixon. I think he's he's one of the most talented running backs in the NFL as far as a PPR back. He's an excellent excellent receiver. And I think that goes under recognized sometimes and I think he's in a prime spot to succeed this year with Zach Taylor hopefully coming over and implementing a lot of the RB usage a lot of passing to the running back. So I'm really really,ant
4766," Pierre Garcon type situation where you're signing someone too long into their career, that's Pierre Garcon got signed with the 49ers and they gave him way too much money for way too long. I'm out of the time and he's not even with the team anymore. So I think that they're going to have to control that contract to be about three years, which is what you want. And I feel like that's great pick. Yeah, so he's signed through 2020. And so that's kind of what you're working with. You got two more seasons under contract with them.",ant

He just looked kind of like a mediocre mover obviously a guy with a lot of heart and his story is really cool story, but you can see how much he loved the game when he played football and just running over people but he wasn't super athletic or anything like that. And then you saw him slim down. He probably lost maybe 10 pounds and then he developed a little bit of quickness with that. And so I really like to see how he has grown since his time at Pitt. And so yeah, I think with the",bee

There's not anybody who can guard them consistently one-on-one throughout the entire game.

AJ Green went and then Patrick Mahomes the first quarterback off the board. This is a 1/4 back.",ant

I thought he was great and I'm excited to have someone that's tied to Aaron Rodgers as it hurts me as a Bears fan. I don't necessarily want Green Bay pliers, but it's going to be an efficient offense and you have the head coaching change where Matt Le Flore.",ant
4770," I'd rather have Josh Jacobs hundred percent I would to I thought I took my question is more. So just do you think that there's any chance that Dion Lewis takes away reps from him going into this year stuff like that. I don't think Derrick Henry will be on the field as as the pass-catching back ever. And so that's a big issue for me as far as having them out there.

They have the defensive structure to be able to hold up and you know, you can definitely see a majority.",ant
4771," Yeah, but the so this being Dynasty you're getting a young wide receiver here that is Elite in an elite offense. And so I'm okay with the pick it may I think you definitely could have waited another round but locking up the number one wide receiver and Fantasies is never a bad option. Yeah, and the bench credit. Why wait why why risk it it's I mean much rather have Tyreke and then worry about",ant

I'm actually fading Jarvis Landry because he's a volume guy and he's gonna get less funny pretty simple, right? So I don't know really where you finish that you finish those a wide receiver to last season and you know, it took him awhile for him and Baker to develop some chemistry.

4779, But I like everything about Kyla movie Kyla Marie moving forward you think about Lamar Jackson taking a huge step in his second year and Patrick Mom's taking a huge step in his second year. I think we'll probably see something similar with Kyler just as he grows more comfortable with the system and he gets on the same page as everybody else in the on the team. There's a tweet thread by Johnny Kingsley that has Kyle Murray's best throws. It is absolutely fantastic. So if you look up Kyle,bee

It's just I'm really high on this class. Yeah, it's all about how you value the quarterback whether you think the the pick is worth it. But oh, yeah, you can't not like Kylie.",ant

4892," That spot too. Yeah, I was gonna say that it depends if you're talking about a lake or a river now if we're talking about rivers, I don't want anybody fishing that spot that I found because everybody in Ohio in the Dayton, Ohio area. There's a lot of people that are Hillbillies and they leave their trash all over the place and they trash my areas in its kind of annoying so I could see that yeah one thing I was going to say, you know, y'all know I'm not really in the tournament scene.",leech

But yeah, so just curious, you know, everybody's left. I agree. I agree. I agree with you Susie. Like that's a great way to learn is just by talking to people. I mean, that's what we do. We talked about fishing here. I mean, yeah, we're not necessarily name and I'll spot but you know, I think with some of that knowledge it could",ant

4899," To make an whatnot, but I absolutely love it. It's it's much bigger. It's roomier. I can hold a lot of stuff the the biggest con for me right now for it is because I'm a shorter person the seat is much more higher behind me and in my out back it was really short. So I'd be able to reach behind me really easily. We're in the pro angler. It's like really tall. So I'm like I can't really reach",bee
4900," And that think they're a beast that you would have to like hit like, I don't know like a big sword or something like a lot and then it'll finally puncture it but like you I've had deep scrapes in it and it didn't faze it so I mean, it just might look ugly on the bottom, but it holds up through rough and tough so it's cool. Yep.",ant
4901," Kind of sit there and I'm just going to paddle. It's just going to be so much easier but like kind of lighter stuff and whatnot it you know, I've I haven't had a chance to really test it out myself, but I'll be able to you know, make a pretty good comparison. Hopefully by midseason this year on the 180 drive and what my turbofan drive was able to do so",ant
4902," Up and then when you're ready to make it go back down on the water it'll go down. But even when it's down if you go over like a stump or something like that, it's not going to bump right on it. It's going to retract up because of that bungee system that it's got in there. So yeah, it's a big piece of mind when you know that you're not going to you know, go through five different covers in a season that you don't need transducer or arms and all the other ship. Yes. Yeah, and that that would kind of be the other thing too is",bee
4903," Play around with that a little bit pedaling down with current. He probably hit like seven mile an hour. All right? Yeah, that's awesome. Did you put the boom box on the PA 14? I sure did I sure did. Yep. Yep. I got The Boondocks. I think like a couple days after I got the kayak and then I got him installed. I got them in solids you shortly before the",ant
4904," Strapped to know ya know I stopped kind of doing that. Well, that's so utilized the strap in the belt pool. I was I was going by myself. But as long as you're wearing your PFD, you'll be a pain. Yeah, but still but still it's just that thought of you know, having a 80-pound kayak tight around your waist and then going Downstream with it. You're just like maybe not so much. It sounds like fun to be let's do it, but",ant
4905, Kind of sort of so they're there. How do you how do you explain it there?,ant
4906," Man, um being able to stand up and stretch out. That's probably the biggest thing because I mean, you know, you think about how long we spend, you know our time in a kayak during a tournament, you know, you're in there like, you know 6 a.m. To 2:00 or 3:00 o'clock. That's a long time and that's if you don't get up and or if you even have the ability to get up so just being able to stand up kind of",bee
4907," Completely front forgot what I was going to say. It's all good. Huh, Brad. Oh, no, I was going to say Loveland canoe and kayak. We it just hit me. I don't know why we try to do demo day at least once a month down here in Ohio this are properties on a river. So if you want to try kayak, you just carry it down the down to the water.",bee

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I brought my con like I said before we're going to talk about feel free kayaks. I don't think that this kayak company gets enough love in the industry. I agree. No and I have one of my best friend's shout out Nate Mahaffey. He's from day one.",bee
4910," Loctite and I've never had a problem again in three years. So yeah, that's that. That's a common thing I hear about. Yeah, you hear that Nate blue Loctite fix it because it's hilarious man. I'll be fishing next time. I'll send here and it's a seat dropping down and I'm like, well there goes the spot sounds like you just dropped an anvil in the water buddy. Yeah. So what's the current lineup that you guys got going on for your fishing kayaks? So it's incredibly exciting.",ant
4911," These products where people can afford them and get them and keep growing the sport, you know, but you know, it's it's a beautiful thing. I love this community. It's got its ups and downs obviously, but I think with companies like feel free it really kind of keeps a positive note and that, you know, they're just aware, you know, and I think that's a really important. So well people don't realize too is feel fries. They're a big company as far as presence, but they're a small company as far as leadership.",bee
4912," I would definitely be in the probably the Allure probably the lure 13:5 for for the bigger Inland Lakes cool. Yeah, I would I would kind of agree and you know what you're starting to see like a little bit of a trend especially with tournament guys that those big boats aren't always your best option, especially if you're fishing a tournament and you're wanting to get from point A to point B fairly quickly that you're seeing some people kind of downsize that's you know, the length and width of their boats so they can you know, they can get there quick as",ant
4913," It into it, you're not attaching something on top of it around it actually slides right in the middle of it and it's incredible the way it's pre setup for it. It's very similar to every other prop drive as far as how it sits in the water how it's used. But the benefit is the inclusion of the motor system the option you can always add the motor system anytime you want and I like that it's all cast aluminum the whole overdrive is cast aluminum. I've had mine for about two years. I've had that same pedal drive I've ran into",bee
4914," The motor off disengage it and just I start paddling and then I'm just like slowly quietly get into my it's like a boat like you come in you like slow down to a no-wake speed and idle into your fishing spot. Then you turn the motor off and go to your trolling motor and troll around same thing in this kayak is in my Dorado is a fly-in. I'll stop or Slow Down Start pedal speed and get around my fishing spot where I need to go and I'll be discreetly in my little spot and start fishing. So the motor is just that when I'm done, I do it in reverse like if I'm tired from fishing all day and I'm worn out or the weather system comes in on you got the water quicker.",ant
4915," it's got like flexible flashlight attached to it. And it's like it's like 30 pounds, but it's like the bed jumps every time it's an amazing battery. I use it for I mean I can use it for five days straight charging everything and it doesn't allow let's on it too, but it's cool. It's good for shows and stuff for like trade shows to but yeah, I think I picked up a new Dakota and then the weight difference is just amazing. Like I went from rocking twenty six two six pounds, and I'm like dude this thing she because I ended up",ant
4916," They don't really take the don't really wear out that often. So yeah that Wheels incredible man, they're so there's like I'll be brutally honest there's one downfall to that wheel or to downfalls that wheel one is it's a you know wheel so you get the wheel barrel effect. So it wants to do this the whole time. So to keep it plain you have to use two hands which isn't that big of a deal. I just II pushed my kayaks that are pulling it. So I it's easier and I'm just like holding like this and then walking the other thing is if you hit loose",ant
4917," You know, so it's like it's perfect and I've seen guys that are like 6 foot 3 6 or 4 do the same thing and there was like, wow, I can stand up easier and like well, yeah, you're you know, like 10 inches off the deck. I mean, it's like you're pretty much standing up already. I mean, it's awesome. So I think the seat and the the height and it goes down lower than any other seat because all the way down flat to the back and it goes in ten positions all the way up and down. So I really think that the seat for feel free is like the most important thing that people need to realize the Comfort I stand on top of the seat and fish most of the time the stability that",bee
4918," Like I said, you can take a Jackson in the ocean. You can take it. You can take it anywhere you want but it's not I don't think it's made for that. Like I don't think it's it doesn't shine in that category compared to a river a river. I would you know, I'd rather be in the moken for feel free or I'd be in a Jackson, you know for a fact so they all have their trade offs in there. And that's I think we'll need to realize is that you need to use the right tool for the right job. That's why when people are like, oh, well, I want to get this boat because you have it. I'm like don't get it because I have it like",ant
4919," The same as the V2 12 that I have that I'm super Blown Away by an oppressed by but it's a 10-foot version and they redid the whole 10 foot version where it can now be Rudder ready and it's got a better standing platform. I mean, it's like that's like a 10 foot boat that weighs under 70 pounds that is that stable is going to be killer on the market and and we're talking about like and I this is super sketchy if I'm not even talk about this but we're talking a boat. That's under 700 bucks. Yeah, you know what? I mean? That's that's",ant
4920," Man, we didn't sign the contract to the end of the year, you know, so it was like a last minute like we were negotiating for so many months and it just happened to me like crap now we got no time.

So absolutely and that's something as a kayaking or is a huge advantage to us is when the ramps are silted up and you they can't launch those vast boats we can drag a kayak out there and get on the water. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, you could",bee
4926," I might move it running moving bait or something like that and just test the waters a little bit, but I'm really not going to have a bait in the water much. I'm going to be either if you're pedaling or paddling or you have a motor same thing covering as much water as I possibly can to see that Lake because when I do start fishing and I do start putting a pattern together, I want to know that I can run over to different parts of that body of water to find, you know, if I'm catching fish.",bee

And so all flip in there with a heavy tungsten weight and whatever bait I prefer it that day. I'll flip that in there into that hole and I usually pick it up that way or then I'll have a hollow body rigged up to",ant

So my theory may be completely wrong. Well, I don't think you're completely wrong. I think you're really close to keying in on what it is. So you said it's really muddy so that can be different for everyone. So what when you talk about Clarity, let's talk about",ant

Its head came out just like a largemouth bass gills flared up and started thrashing its head and it almost it almost breached on my kayak meant as a first time.

4947, It almost looks like a baby.,bee
4948," Yeah, that's definitely something different. I've heard it. They used to be real prevalent and I've seen some small ones throughout the years but these that I caught that year which is abnormally big for I thought at least for that area, you know, so but you know, I'll take the trade-off of that day catching the selfish and not putting Barracuda footage will say that one for maybe some other time.

4954," You know and matched it according to that like around here. We have a lot of those like Coast like like white colored little tiny Bait fish that I see a lot of times it'll bass will be chasing after we have something called a central Stone roller, which is a big color that I'm using now, which is like kind of a black on top and a bluish Hue on the bottom. And so there's one I used it's called.",ant
4955," You know, but what I ended up doing this kind of switching it up and you downsize the bait because most of the time the bait fish that I'm seeing are almost five inches long, you know in our Rivers occasionally, you'll see schools arshad like that, but they're kind of few and far between but so I downsized I went down to four three and eventually I actually made myself last year. I started throwing the 3/8 and that just seems to match what's in the water a lot.",bee

4957, Fishing and so I was going down a little ways and he turned around looked at means like heading look and and he says he's an odds just too hot and he grabs a stuff and he starts leaving why go down probably 40 50 foot from where he was and start casting Whopper plopper 90 sides and the loom color first some casting.,ant
4958," You know add some It's Tricky but you know, sometimes it could be as matter of downsizing the bait, you know, throwing a grub instead of the kai Tak or whatever. But you know, it's a it's a learning experience and and with rivers their ever-changing. They're constantly constantly changing every year. I'll go back to some of the spots that I used to start out fishing and you can't fish them anymore because it's so shallow because the rocks have moved, you know.",bee
4959," About this smallmap. I've yet to catch a big large mouth. I've caught some a couple 18s, but I don't think I've caught a 19-inch yet real out though. Yeah, they 7 the 17. I caught at Brian's was huge. He was probably one of the fattest fish I've ever caught that thing was probably five pounds easy, and it was only a 17 inch fish. We know I was about to brag because",bee
4960," Edit like when I fish that bait is I'm going to fish looking for what's called an Eddy and that's where the river like takes a turn. It kind of creates a big bro pull effect, you know and and he's can be big like I've fished some that are like, you know, 50 yards long and you know, 25 yards wide, they're big and then I found fish and ones that are literally like two feet by two feet and those are tricky.",ant
4961," I won't wait. I'll up the line weight to because I'll go like 12, maybe 15 or even 17 but it all kind of just depends on what I'm going to be throwing if I'm throwing a jig and the rivers or even in the Lakes. I'm going to put on it at least at least 15 pound just because I'm doing heavier weights and stuff like that and you're throwing in to cover or against the rocks or whatever and you know, it's easy to break fluoro when you're like don't go an eight pound test you.",ant
4962, Furs were just a mess. They were up high and I learned a behavior that Smallmouth have you known I was they like to sit in the weeds man or like in these little pockets that are like kind of where the water starts to drain out and it's like Sandy and Rocky right there and they were in the water you could see two inches into the water. It's completely milky and I started throwing like basically like little TRD little TRD is a little,bee
4963," As far as doing that like I said, there's been times that I've had to Jiggle It on the bottom like slowly fish it on the bottom and I'll get hit when it was muddy. I threw the white one a lot and the way I learn that the fish were biting when the water was really up in the river and it was ruled dirty and you couldn't barely see I do that what I want and I treated it almost like a spinnerbait man.

They weren't wanting to eat but you've made a meat and they're going to",ant

However, I've had great success with this Rod like it goes against everything like before I got this ride. I was using Amy",ant

There's no exact like line. There's no exact you need to do this. Every time the only thing you need to know is like cold water clear water works for a jerkbait. It elicits very very light.",ant

They will and the winter they'll just sit there and the river anyway, but you know at this time of year, I don't feel like they're there yet. So that's sweet.

There's you know, just take something that you might have some mild interest in learning and then just make it your own and I think that's the best way that you can go about fishing and just put time into get good at whatever that is.

I know that Cody and Kurt like Kurt helped Cody design Eckhart Smits did I think and their thought process was to make it easier to hook set obviously.

Yeah from being with like the creepy people for six years and not remembering anything else. Yeah. That's all she's ever known. But then when she finally",ant
6774," Really good, like she was not designed for the male gaze at all. And I appreciate that is actually a good point see the whole no plot and snow story kind of overshadowed the fact that yeah, she's actually yeah. No, she's just she's just a superhero. She's not like she's just she's not like black widow who uses her sexuality for everything, which is awesome. He doesn't treat you much. You know, she does it because but she is designed in a way to appeal to the male gaze same kind of as Wonder Woman, but I feel like they play with us.",bee
6775,"Hey guys, welcome to episode one today. We're going to introduce ourselves as well as the podcast. We're also going to have a short discussion about positive self-talk toward the end. So since this is our first episode and we're kind of just break in the ice. We are going to skip over the part that we are going to have in the rest of our episodes moving forward after this kind of where we talk about how we rose up as a couple that week, but also how we fell as a couple that week and what we want to do to improve it something where you can get more of an Insight onto our",bee
6776," She just always had such a positive attitude and she ate healthy and she just seemed so happy and I was just was not in that place at all. And she just had such a big influence on my life. It kind of was a wake-up call for me, especially since we shared the same room in our sorority house, but we were very close considering it was like a shoebox type room. So I just adapted to her ways and it completely changed my life forever. So I honestly give majority of the credit to Haven.",ant
6777," Good things that come up that are really hard to deal with and give you tips on to. Yeah. Well, we thought it was perfect mainly because we feel like we were so in the dark before learning the things that we now know that we practiced every day that help us to be happy and healthier. So we think it's the easier way to live life by knowing these things and practicing them all the time and helping you take the easy Road versus the hard bargain. Yeah, which is what we want to do so there.",ant
6778," To do and overall just becoming sad so we really think that it's important to practice this everyday if you want to be serious about it because that's what we do because we want to be happy and spread happiness everyday because it's important and we think it can change your life. If you're living a life where you're unhappy and you start practicing this it can very well change your life and it might change someone else's life around you if you're happy and you're spreading it. Yeah. I posted this on my Instagram the other day and Gary Vee is the one who said it, but he said you have to be selfish but",ant
6779," Yeah, anyways, so what just happened we experience a ton of technical difficulties. I've been sitting here for like an hour maybe longer trying to figure out what the heck was wrong because we normally record an audacity and audacity was having all these problems because I just updated my computer and I couldn't figure out for the world of me how the heck to get my mic to work and to get it to record. So that was just craziness going on Bianca like escaped and was taken some photos and I was just over here like YouTube. How do I",ant
6780," Think of to start your day off in that positive space and by thinking those things and by bringing in all that positivity, I saw this quote and I think Bianca changed the motivational quote. Did you change it did you but you pulled one up? Okay. So I'll go ahead and say the quote that I found that involves gratitude and I think it helped spearhead of what I'm trying to say. So it says gratitude turns what we have into it.",ant
6781, Life and just something that can constantly give you happiness without you having to go and get something materialistic or achieve a certain thing just to be happy because that's what like this whole thing is all about like gratitude is about being happy based on the things you already have and just recognizing that they are something that can and should make you happy. Yeah. Well also if you do start off your morning in a negative way,ant
6782," I don't have the cleanest like sometimes so I don't really mind it if I'm being honest, but I don't know sometimes it's just nice to have someone say like get up and work hard and that's basically what he says. So there's just a ton every day something motivational something that makes you be like, okay, I am like yeah bad. But yeah, I can get this stuff done. Yeah, and I think we just live in a world to where it's so easy to become distracted by everything else.",ant
6783," Morning, when I'm thinking about my Y and my purpose and I always have that moment where I'm like talking to myself and I'm like telling myself to like always be the man that my future children will look up to and I deserve but I yeah, when I do that, this is like super raw and you guys are getting the inside scoop on Collins personality and it what's in my head right now little even though I am emotional I'm gonna I mean like and in reality, I think anyone who says they're not emotional.",ant
6784," I'm letting go of all these feelings and pushing them out into the universe and I will actually take my hands and like put them on my chest and like push them away. Like I'm like letting out all those negative things because I don't need them right now. And then that after I do that, I honestly feel really good. And then I that's when I started bringing in all the positive thoughts. Well, yeah, and also if you're constantly being negative and feeling down and then all you're going to do is attract more negativity, so you physically have to push it away.",bee
6785," So with manifestation you can manifest your goals and your dreams, but you can also manifest like the things around you like if you want a really positive friend group start envisioning yourself with people who are really positive if you want, she'll tell the story about how I think I from my side manifested a relationship sure if you want go ahead. Okay, so honestly people just message me kind of often.",ant
6786," Ever that likes I'm a Christian and I all I believe in God and I believe he has like a plan for me and I just trust that he has it set in motion and that it's going to come to me and that's what happened. So, I don't know that she's it's great. She's playing right into those years. But yeah, that's kind of like the way I believe stuff and like think about things in a way it's kind of manifestation, but it's a lot different what Bianca was talking about but I think it like it's well, I also think that praying",leech
6787," I look down all the time. It's like a different 501 difficult but I see the 4:13 and like I'm doing good. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No. No, it's just like a whole nother thing manifestation grabs take those two numbers. So wild I know other people do this because I've read about it. So somebody on Google knows about it. That's all that matters true. Well, all right guys, have fun with the why work and we will see you next Monday. That is a wrap for today's episode. Thank you guys so much for taking the time to listen.",ant
6788," I'm not jealous. Yeah, you should be talking to each other. I always say one day when calling and I get married. He's going to just spit out the best values because he's so poetic because when I'm nervous we had talked about it last night we watching",ant
6789," kind of had the realization that you guys follow me because you like who I am as a person. So if I could open up more in a track the people who do like me more as a person everyone may not like it but the people who will like it are the people who I care about because they're the ones who support, you know, so you can't let the people who judge you or anything bring you down and you need to live for yourself. And so that's a huge thing for me in 2020 is Colin says this all the time but he's always says to stop living for other people to start living for yourself. So my goal is to continue",ant
6790," So we do want to get a puppy this coming year and I'm so excited. Oh my God, you guys already know I love golden retrievers. We already have a name picked out and everything. I think it's going to be a huge experience for me and Collin together as a couple just having to be responsible for this little fur ball, and I'm so excited and I've only been talking about it since the day I met Colin again like when we started hanging out again, so yeah, I'm very very excited about the puppy. That's not the only reason we do you save money because we're also looking",bee
6791," Not even have an argument but just like discuss if one of us is upset about something we will always have to ask each other like 10 times. What's wrong are you? Okay? And it's funny because we can instantly what's going on. Yeah. We only know every single time if Bianca's upset. I know she's upset so same for you. And yeah, I know I know same for me but it always takes each of us look on your face like five or ten times to finally get it up finally get the person to be vulnerable and just Express what?",ant
6792," You can do to constantly improve. So then that's one category focus on that. The move on next one is career goals. So I did want to mention this. I think that this is super important to note is that career goals can be kind of tricky because if you're just focusing on the year of 2020, for example, you can't set a career goal. That's out of your control meaning you can't set a goal and hope to achieve something when you have to rely on.",bee
6793," In trunk, that's just what I wanted to hit about career goals because I think setting career goals is pretty tricky and that it's very easy to get upset. Especially when you don't hit your career goals, and that's something I've done to myself for the past couple years and I wanted to bring that to everyone's attention and mainly to my attention because this year is the first year. I am absolutely not writing any gold down that has to do with how many subscribers I have or how many Instagram followers I have because at the end of the day that's not important and what's important.",bee
6794," To achieve the long-term goals. Yeah, so that kind of is daunting to some people those two things about having short-term goals and long-term goals are like, oh my God, what do I do first? And what do I do now? And it's all about just prioritizing riding them all out and then being able to decipher which ones I need to accomplish first. Yeah to get me to the long-term goals and which goals makes most make the most sense to accomplish first or to focus on first. Yeah, because you don't want to do something that's unrealistic because then it's just going to lead you to being really disappointed in yourself, and then you're more likely.",ant
6795," Gout like yeah. Those are your short-term goals to get to the long term and your long-term could literally be tomorrow, you know what I mean? So it's all about how you look at it but there's always subgoals to a huge goal. Hmm, and there's always subgoals to a small goal because you have to do something to get somewhere you have to yeah, and those big goals lead to your dream. So yeah bam anyways, you know, it's time for that motivational quote, of course. Okay. So today's quote is brought.",ant
6796," Men that you start taking care of yourself and start getting on a path where you're putting your own meant like mental health and physical health and just overall your well-being before everything else. And then your relationship is going to get so much better. Your whole life is going to get so much better. It totally just transforms everything when you start putting yourself first in terms of being happy. So yeah, that's my self-confidence talk.",ant
6797," Don't properly take care of themselves way. They should like even with me and Bianca we didn't do it until a certain point. So if you're listening to this and you feel overwhelmed, maybe bike like maybe because you feel like you're not properly doing everything. You should be don't feel overwhelmed. Just know that with time it's going to come and eventually you're going to get to that point where you're taking care of yourself all the way, but I think it's really just about taking small steps. And once you get a few things down, just keep that",bee
6798," Back because that's just kind of the way I should say Eddie works. I think it's a big issue that when someone is mean we all just want to do the exact same thing because we feel like they were being mean when you know that I feel like it's a big problem. I feel like a lot of people just always look to yeah. It's just a real problem. And I think like if you grew up Christian, it's one of those things that like at least my mom always talked about was like you want to treat people the way you want to be treated. So like even if someone",ant
6799," I think it's really helpful that kind of leads into your next one. Hmm. So next well next. I'm going to do never criticize and instead discuss how you feel and why and this kind of goes well with the respond other than any other way than angry too, even though it doesn't have to do necessarily with responding. This is more. So just about any issues that come about in your relationship. So",bee
6800," Is if you do resent because of expecting something I've from your partner, then you're probably going to have an argument or something and over time. It's just going to build up. Yeah, and then it's going to turn into a bigger argument, but it's really just about having the realization that you're expecting something that maybe you've never talked about. But also if you want something you just have to say it because your partner isn't a mind reader like I can't read Collins mind. I wish I could and he can't read mine.",ant
6801, Is true vulnerability and at these are all like stacking well off of one another right now. So this is good with the whole expectations thing because we were talking about how you just have to talk and tell them what you want. So with vulnerability. It's kind of the same thing. You have to be able to truly Express how you feel about anything and I think you have to be able to accept,ant
6802," That they really really want something to be that way and you don't at all. So for instance prime example of for compromise is for me and Collin and Orangetheory. Do you want to tell them so I go every Saturday with Bianca to Orangetheory and I got my own membership where I go once a week, but at first when we were first dating, I just really didn't want to go at all and but it was really important to Bianca.",ant
6803," You're on the same page and always make sure that you're telling people that like hey, I really liked when you did this like he calling I really liked when you firming things that they did that are good usually do it. Like yeah, we're doing that. You know what I mean? And then also like hey, I didn't really like when we did this this week. Maybe let's try and do this instead next week, you know, yeah, it's about having that space every week or whenever you do it where you can be like super vulnerable and it's just",ant
6804," Person all the time, but that's just not who we are as human beings and you have to be willing to accept and have those conversations because if not, you will not have a successful or great relationship. Yeah, so we hope",bee
6805," You're chasing who you want to be. So because at the end of the day, yes, you have goals, but you will never reach them or achieve them. If you don't have something to light your path exactly we want to talk about what it can do for you because it's not it's so important to figure it out and to understand what your why is but it gives you confidence it helps. You know, who you are you figure you ground yourself you figure out who you are why you're here. Just giving yourself.",ant
6806," The same for you, too, when you're first trying to nail it down because it's it's a little daunting. It's hard. It's kind of hard because I think it takes a lot of self-reflection at first because right now if you're in a position where I was when I didn't have a why I was kind of wandering through life. I didn't know what I wanted to do kind of lost track of who I was and let's not mention that every family member is like, what are you gonna do with your life? Yeah, so it's kind of stressful at times, but I think",ant
6807, Growing in your learning along the way and if you aren't kind to yourself and you don't give yourself what you deserve and you don't feel yourself with positivity. Then you're only going to get negativity back. And if you're at a place in your life where you are just evolving with so much positivity. Then that's going to come into your life with a partner. I think one more thing to think about how you can figure out why is like I said self-reflect and then after that self-reflection you would just have to be honest with,ant
6808," Because taking the first steps like Bianca said might take a month might take a week. But once you take those first steps after that, it's really about being consistent and it's about not forgetting what that purpose isn't that why isn't about everyday practice and everyday reminders and that's really what's going to help you become the person you want to be. I wanted to give a little motivational quote to you guys because that's what we're going to do every single episode around the topic. So this one is pretty basic and I've seen so many people",ant
6809," You don't know like what someone actually is putting behind it. You just see the words. So I was on my way to the gym and Bianca's like where are you? But she never she never here. Hold on. She never normally messages me and it's where and then the letter r in the letter you normally there's like a little bit more there. So I was like what the heck this seems weird. We also drive separately to the gym because sometimes sometimes I leave the gym a little bit early and go take an orange theory class. Yeah, so I told her because I had to sit in.",bee
6810," Because I like just wasn't showing my love. Lianca was Bianca's was extremely unaffectionate to me. Let's just be honest and it is feel that way. You hear that. She even just said that she didn't feel that way. So this this is flame know. Like how was I not affectionate? Because I think I was I'd rather not talk about this, but let's just be honest here. Okay. So do you want to jump into the next one and express your thoughts? Let's",ant
6811," Yeah, when you said that if I didn't I'll say it again physical touch quality time and words of affirmation are mine. Okay. So the only thing that's different between me and it's just the placement. No, no, you are words of affirmation and I'm acts of service. Oh, yeah, I'm definitely more of a words of I from yeah. Okay. Glad we cleared that up goodness. Anyways, those are our love languages and then honestly Colin and I talked about Love Languages like really early.",ant
6812," yeah, I also think if you have an ask your partner what their love languages are you definitely should write after this episode, but also I feel like that's a great first date topic it really is and if not a first date topic, like if you're just all getting to know each other first and then you want to talk about it like do it then but it's definitely something that you want to know because if not, then you're doing a disservice to your partner and really hard and yourself but more so it's about knowing how to have the",ant
6813," As a person being mature and our relationship would have to be like babe. I understand you feel so strongly about this. I'm willing to come meet you halfway compromise and make sure that we are both happy. Yeah, so if you guys aren't willing to do that then yes, I would say that you could be incompatible. Yeah, but I think also the same time it's really important that Bianca mentioned that because even if you think you won't be compatible you're never gonna know until you actually try and to be honest if you're not willing to try you probably shouldn't be in a relationship in general because",bee
6814," I heard about This Thing Called Love Languages, and you could tell them a little bit about it kind of give them a summary of what it is and say would you be open to taking a quiz so we can find out what ours are and then go from there. And then that way after you guys take the quizzes you can share your results then you can talk about what yours mean like what your love language is mean you can talk about it to that person to your boyfriend and then he can do the same to you and then it's all about just being as open and transparent as possible like",ant
6815," You need to break all connection of contact with that person because if not, you're only going to be like trying to hang on as much as you can. So that is my biggest tip. I know it's hard but you have to set like a barrier up and cut off all connection and contact or else you're only hurting yourself and it's only making it harder for you. I think that's probably like Step 1 cut all that and then like start moving forward with other stuff about like finding yourself thinking about what you need to do a big thing is just not",ant
6816," Ali hard, I think maybe just say like hey, can we talk real quick? I just have something I really want to talk to you about and then say that and it can dramatically alter how you feel in your relationship. And I think it's super important. You have to be willing to be vulnerable like but I mean also the whole words of affirmation thing you have to do some research like Bianca said go online you can look and see what some stuff you could try out is and you have to be willing to go out on a limb and just give it a shot. Yeah, true that okay.",ant
6817, Day and make sure you don't forget to leave a review and radar podcast so we can reach as many people as possible. We seriously can't wait to read the reviews you guys leave. I'm so excited. But that's all for today the easy way or the hard way.,ant
6818," And I think that I'm thankful and I'm sure you're thankful for those couple of years of how much we grew up and changed as a person throughout those couple of years. And also, I don't think that people are old enough at age 18 to know what you want to do for the rest of your life so that I just have mixed feelings about college. I did graduate for those of you who don't know but if I could have dropped out I was obviously I don't know because I didn't immediately stay home and I immediately went to college After High School, but I honestly am kind of curious as to what",bee
6819," what we're doing right now in our life and not to rush things and I honestly think that this started or stemmed from me being in college and just hating it so much and wanting to graduate and I do truly think that that's when this all started for me because I would always say like, I'll be so much happier when I graduate and then next it was I'll be so much happier as soon as Colin and I move in together and then next it's just like an ongoing spiral and then that just leads me to never actually being able to be happy with where we are in that moment because I'm always",ant
6820," So another thing that I learned is that you don't have to have it all figured out in your 20s or even your 30s and I feel like right now is just a time for trial and error and you guys know we listen to Gary Vee practically every single day of the week and he preaches this and he said he didn't even have his life figured. He still doesn't have his life figured out. There's people who are 50 and don't even have their life figured out. Well one thing that Gary talks about all the time and I just think it's so important to here because a lot of people don't think about this, but all the",ant
6821," Yeah, I agree. I think that's definitely true. Thanks. Next one. We have how importantly next one we have is how important a daily routine is for your happiness? So I definitely learned this this past year. I started implementing it the year before but this past year is definitely where I realized how important it really is because it helped pull me out of a dark place, but also I realized when I stopped doing it every single day and took a lot of time.",ant
6822," I like it a lot. Yeah, and if you can't go every week maybe try and go two weeks out of the month or yeah, or just also realize that you don't have to go to a super nice place every single time. It could be anywhere. Yeah, it could even be an at-home date night or it could be like a walk in a park.",bee
6823," But also like the past couple months, I've been uploading every single day to YouTube and then also trying to do Instagram every day and like watch this podcast and get a bunch of things going and it was just so I was so worn out and it just turned into a negative effect. I feel like it was just flooding me and my life and probably flooding you guys to it so much like content videos and sometimes I think working less is better. So instead of like working hard work.",ant
6824," They were doing then like doing my own research reading all that stuff. So we just really want to help and mainly just take advice from the people who you look up to exactly pigment or yeah, don't listen to people who don't know what they're talking about. It's very much. Like they'll act like they want they know but it's more so that a lot of people can lead you in the wrong direction on accident. Yeah, and I think I just think it's really important. Yeah, that's true. Okay. So this is my last one and",bee
6825," So that kind of wraps up the 19 things that we learned in 2019. I'm excited to do this episode again at the end of this year, which is crazy. So me to probably around like 365 days long time from now, but that'll be exciting. I think it was really fun honestly to do this episode and think about all these things that we've learned but also think about how we can continue to implement them. And if you guys want to you can take any of these things and you can implement the like all that as well, so",ant
6826," Off in order to get rid of really bad habits and you have to sit there and think for yourself and do this yourself. No one else is going to do it for you. You're in charge. You need to figure this out before the new year because I want everyone to start off 2020 with a kick. If you're sleeping in too late. Guess what sister or brother grind season doesn't happen at night. It happens when you wake up early in the morning and get stuff done. You're not cool. If you stay up till 4:00 in the morning and sleep till two o'clock. That's not going to do anything productive for you or your future. Well, I think",ant
6827, Give this some thought because both of us were in a situation. At least I was where my bad habits. Let me to extreme depression at the time that I started turning things around. So if you are at a point where you're just hanging out with people and getting drunk all the time or getting high all the time or just doing stupid stuff all the time because you think it's the cool thing to do. We're just being honest. That's just not how it's going to be as soon as you leave college and the real world is going to be you either get your,bee
6828," Why in the world are we not going to just start sharing this stuff all the time? So yeah. Yeah readings huge and then this is another one that's really important for us and it's learned daily. And so I think that's something that's really important is as a person you need to always be coachable. You don't know at all and I learned this the most when I was training to be an orange theory coach actually if you guys don't know I used to coach at Orangetheory. It was super fun, but they said in order to be a good coach you have to be coachable and I applied that to life in general.",ant
6829," He even been mad in the first place. Then I could beat myself up and be really upset for the rest of the day or I could take the five minutes that I need to just recognize what I did apologize to her and apologize to myself for being negative and for being that way and I think we didn't really talk about this at all. But actually saying the words I forgive you to yourself just like positive self-talk you could do it in the mirror or whatever actually saying those words. I think really helps. Yeah, it's super",ant
6830," Is totally okay. We all have to remind ourselves what we need to do to make ourselves better and trust me. You will change if you are doing this homework. I know it's crazy and you're like, oh my God, you don't work. We should probably find something better than homework to call it. But it seriously works and you have to be disciplined enough to want to change your life. And then once you decide that you are going to do that for yourself, then that's when you need to be relentless, but I could have a whole episode on relentlessness. So we'll do that. But I did want to tell you guys the motivational quote of the",ant
6831," From a wise sage like my grandma. I looked up to her a lot. She's a was she's a great example of service always serving and blessing those around her and just to overall great person. Well, she's 98 years old and it's last week. She she fell and broke her hip and for those who have had elderly grandparents who will",bee
6832," A while they might be like, okay. This guy's not a threat. I kind of like him. So there's the bribing version right and with puppies, of course, we're going to use food and we're going to let my Grandma had a candy jar, right? Of course that brought us to her more. We love that. You know, we would go and go to Grandma's and we always had to ask your Grandma. Can we have some candy and she'd say, oh you'll spoil your dinner and then we say promise we won't grandma and she'd say okay if you promise you won't spoil your dinner.",leech
6833," A lot of times you can have as good of or better of a relationship than the owner does at least in the sense that the dog is going to say. I trust you more and if I you know, I feel more stability around you they may not say, you know, they may say hey, I know this person will give me what I want. I'll do a little bit of parent shopping that way and I totally did that as a kid when it came down to",bee
6834," But today and tomorrow, I'm sorry today and tomorrow I will go and to the funeral of my grandma an amazing woman that I will love and cherish and meet again because relationships are eternal.",bee
6835, Oh this worked. This is it like this. This is the one that did it for this dog that nothing else seemed to work for and so I thought huh. I wonder if it was just this dog or any other dog and as I've gone through more training for myself and practice with more dogs. What I've come to learn is it totally works because Focus kills chaos is solves the problem and so I tried to get ahold of this.,ant
6836," Lee involuntary it's happening. So this reflex gets so many people in trouble because of things like that. There's going to be maybe aggression issues a lot of almost all of the aggression issues we deal with are connected to this and their fear related. So a dog is nervous, but our communication their reflex is saying you have to go to this thing that's nervous and you're not prepared for it.",leech

There will be,bee

They did it on purpose ha ha still looking forward to it and crash. What were your thoughts? And I mean we were just up there together in the thick of it for this we were and like this is I think we're talking about a little bit before we started the show is you and I really haven't had a chance to absorb all of",bee
6991," Kind of cryptic because when you think about heroin it's like Affliction or to cause distress. So we're talking a little bit about it before the show to is I personally think that a harrow storm being kind of dolman type thing might allude to the very beginning of that trailer. If you haven't seen the trailer then definitely go check it out, but there's a park in the trailer right at the beginning when you know liras comes back and everybody cheers and while they're going through this",ant

6993," So we learned that scrying is kind of a color shape or a color and a shape Match Game in one so that sounds like a pretty exciting thing. They also said that they're going to make it very accessible for people that might have color blindness or anything like that. So they're yes, they're already on the ball with that. I really like that. They've been a lot more conscious of people that have any form of, you know, hard time seeing their content. They've been paying more attention asking more questions and then do we know more about the Excavating system. Did they talk about that a lot? I don't remember.",bee
6994," I can't even imagine your guilds are often formed around seeking lore as the name implies the idea for filling that owl and chasing these items down seems what they described as like Indiana Jones meets Elder Scrolls. Holy shit. That's a yeah. I hope I just about flipped people. I know they're going to have multiple items. Obviously. There's going to be all base game all DLCs anywhere that's got any land you're gonna be able to find stuff which is awesome including the old chapters, but",ant
6995," has go back spell crafting at some point because the entire idea there was like you collect runes you put the rooms together to create the spell. This would be a fantastic place to hide runes. Definitely a good point. That is super solid well and you know, they've also made sure to shroud the end of the year and mystery like I don't mean to be that guy that's overhyping us now, but and I was really encouraging rich and like keep it a secret as possible. You don't want to know all of our Christmas gifts too early, and he really did he stayed strong to that idea.",ant
6996," A June extreme height and then we go. Oh, it's just dungeons know it's just a story but it's damn good content. Like any other game would be like, oh my God, like what are you giving us? So I think shrouding this whole year in mystery is gives them a little bit of latitude maybe and what they want to throw as when we I just get the feeling this is not it I think something crawled down gun also solves a problem you were dealing with last year with elsewhere was kind of like the announcement up front was oh, hey dragons and think",ant
6997," which they confirmed we may or may not see farmer down there. It's like of course they're down there. So you have to be able to run into that stuff. It is going to harken back to those days.

I have one. I have one and with two skills and an ultimate and just the passives eventually I managed to make it as close to an active vampire as possible and it was actually pretty successful but given us a whole skill line.",bee
6999," Yeah, that's a good point. That would be awesome, you know like to follow up from that the Dark Brotherhood stuff if you run up you stab and there's a passive way. You can go invisible. Why don't you go put them invisible? Whereas if you have the bat of the vampire version you run up bite on the back of the neck duck turn into bats and fly off somewhere like a little flip round of it. That would be nuts and also don't forget there was a vampire dude in charge of that good stuff.",ant

Yeah, if you got any cosmetic toggle item, like I've got the usually have the sun visors like the goggles slotted someplace in a quick bar so I can just activate those in turn them off. That'll fix it. But if you don't know what's causing it, that one can be a real pain in the ass. Yeah, and that does need to get fixed. I agree. I think that's it. That's a tedious one. I think I said that when I first started playing my first",ant

You can't well, you also can't equip a sword and then use a desk or a staffs. Correct, right? Yeah. Well, that's a good point. The only the only fire damage ranged fire damage.

7003, Definitely excited about the the story that's coming and to be able to in our game in ESO to be able to go into the depths of black reach. I think that is going to bring me right back to some of the first hours of me playing elderscrolls V really excited about the about the lore content that's going to be amazing.

But again, why let it happen in chat was my community spoke very adamantly against it, you know saying hey, none of this is what you're saying is right like no one no one in this chat shares your opinion, except you. Yeah. And so again, that's where we're setting up. This this is conversation for this episode Stark. Would you like to talk about our next topic here gatekeeping and what this means is we lead into it.",leech

So he's looking for it as character test and I can get behind that. In other cases. I've seen it where it was just kind of like, oh, no you need to be able to do VMA Flawless for you can't do trials and say that's not how the game works. Yeah, those those two things are like like you said a character test is one thing but the VMA is",bee

I say fake it times but man, I mean, they're they're not they're not the fact that I can walk into a room and never have met you in person and but you and I pick up a conversation like we had just met for lunch the day before. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's",ant

He like bombarded me with DM's telling me how I was a terrible person. I wasted two hours of his life that this is more than just a game all this other stuff. And I said look, man, you got to understand I'm teaching these two people, you know, this was a teaching run and you know, it was a Learning lesson. We went in there.

They're looking for you to lose your cool to flip out not necessarily even because they're trying to set bait up so that they can have you you know censured but because that's what they're doing for their entertainment. So yeah, if somebody gets you like that and gets on your nerves don't engage exactly hard because it's a natural instinct to go no, wait, that's wrong, but",ant

I don't care what the principles of ESL are. I don't care how the design of it works. I know this because I played a different MMO.

It's like that's not yeah, especially when you're getting in there and getting the vet content and somebody cues in and it's very clearly not a tank. You're not even gonna attempt to be a tank and it's like us it's deceptive. It's it doesn't come from a good it's selfish. Well, it's also yeah, it's selfish.

Your job is not to be able to do everything right your job is to know your team and know who can do what? Yep so that you can allocate them. You can point somebody when they're the best choice. I completely agree with that that is that is one of my strong tenets IRL that I think that you know, that's what makes a good boss a good, you know anything.",bee

He is a great thing to air out and just talk about and you know, everyone find what your passion is in this game. Your options are endless. Now Ranger you want to pimp out some places they can find you across the internet. Yeah. She's so the best place to find me is if you have Twitter, it's just act casual underscore Ranger. That's that's my main platform. I don't stream anymore. I do plan to on the",ant

If you're if you're looking to get more information on certain classes are guides or anything like that sign has got a fantastic site that will have pimped out throughout the episode, but we thought you'd be a perfect person to talk to because of that approachability because you make content that is very easy for people to get into and explains itself. Well, so today let's let's dive into this this concept.",ant
7023," you may have to work above and beyond your own skill set just because people are not necessarily paying attention or you might get one where they've really really really good and they just smash through it. But either way you'll get the experience and you will get Luther you can sell and you can probably put on but if you are going for something really specific and you know, where it is avoid that one dungeon avoid that one and you know, I'm gonna spell we laugh don't do see if I should see P10. Oh, yeah now that's a great 149.",ant

You can everybody starts somewhere that sound like do people well to remember that basically and a lot of people do especially if you speak up. Yeah. And so again, you know, if you're looking to do the quest say it if you're if you're struggling with mechanic don't hesitate to say that too because I mean PD we're going to be happy to be like look this is what this is what's happening here, so that kind of",ant
7025," Yeah, it's a it's very important and I think I guess that ties into this idea of how when you're testing your DPS. I mean, you can't you really can't can't get an effective gauge of your DPS. If you are, you know lower than level 50 for example, because that would be buffed stats can make you competitive in other areas. Yeah, it does to some extent and then also what you have to consider is of course, I mean being Max EP doesn't make everything.",ant
7026," Look, they look absolutely insane and broken and there's a lot of people who look at the training dummies and go. Oh I can pull this amount on a dummy clearly. This will translate directly to live another one that comes to mind actually and this is from a little bit ago, but Acuity was a similar thing where it's like if you're on a dummy it's really easy just to proc it and call it a day because it will look amazing and then in live content when you're actually trying to use it in an actual boss fight it can be absolutely terrible. Well, that's the that's the thing about Relic win. For example",ant
7027," Now I'm just putting that on from that one. And then you progressively learn over time what its benefits are and all the rest of it. But yeah, definitely understand your skills read them definitely read them, but try stuff out above all you've got to try stuff out. Yeah, definitely agree. So we kind of do drew that distinction to you know, you're going to try these as your leveling that's going to give you an idea of what a live combat situation is versus a just parsing on some some dummy in someone's you know house that that's a great way to get a check of your numbers that",ant
7028," Tara it's good to be pushed to the edge of death where you kind of realize. What do I start doing when my health is almost gone. That's very true. When it comes to to that depends on what class you are as to what heels or survivability you have to your in Your Arsenal basically, but as far as potions are concerned like higher tier stuff like over 160 when you're really trying to push it as not as a new player bout you just go and kind of mid-range area. That's when you'll be looking at potions for more damage output and more buff up times and stuff like that when your lower level around the one",ant
7029," be a friend or you're just on your own you just want to see to try your luck with them. You will actually learn quite a lot from them. You'll be able to apply damage to it. You'll be able to see the damage that they do unto you and all the different mechanics and such. So the basics of block interrupt stay up stupid all that kind of stuff will apply to some of the base game buses and you'll have a much better chance against those rather than the say not necessary the higher tier, but the more recent stuff if there's two of you have and you've got a tank go nuts. He can hold it still and practice the mechanics will you do",bee
7030," James want you to have more of can I ask a general rule of thumb? What do you think is a good health for you know, either your stamina DPS or Magicka DPS to go in and say their level 160. What do you think is a good kind of average people don't begin a one a little bit more than what you would hire CPS because your resistance is in your Champion points will be lower. So you will take more damage. So if I want to aim for about eighteen something like 20, but you don't have to go that",ant
7031," Output of damage being your light or heavy attacks, even though you're still using skills, even though you've got dots down an error affects down and all that good stuff doing loads of damage some of your highest damage output is actually a light attacks and people forget about that bass ability and that's free. So you've got to weave them in every other skill put one in even on a Healer to procure glyphs you can still get away with that. Yeah, very true. I'm on the tank. Yes, definitely on a tank. You can procure glyphs you can definitely have your tackles a tank. Don't just hold block all day.",ant
7032," Sara Lee come introducing weapon skills or Guild skill line and stuff I get because that can also change the tide of it all of them great point. But at base that's that's kind of their that overlay if you like what overview even him so I guess yeah. Yeah, that's that's very important because you know, if you're moving from one class to another and especially we encourage that for players that are just starting out the one I'm gravitating the most towards if you are just starting you want to take your character to about level 22 get a",bee

This is going to start opening that up to Templars if they keep doing this I'm gonna be really excited.",ant
7037," attached to it there been changes in the travel time for the projectile on the whole and this is when you look at the knife blade changes, there's a couple of major nerves here when you play them. You don't feel the nerves as much and some of the buff some of the changes have now actually are actually significant now in ways, they didn't used to be so anybody who's getting okay.

These are gonna be very abbreviated and I think the idea here is I think there are strengths and weaknesses for each class when it comes to tanking we hate to say, you know learn well I shouldn't say we hate",ant

Say it DK where you just pop one out right off your classical line having said that they've got a really nice Health scaling Shield. Like I said a minute ago, like they have one, you know, they're a couple words like the health scaling thing is actually a shield instead of damage. I said of healing and the Templar has one where it's a shield. They've got a couple",bee

One of them is you actually get a health scaling heal for each Target you hit with it. Whoo, so and that's coming off of a passive. It's not coming off the ability itself. So we were talking about, you know, the importance of passives earlier. This is you know, previous episodes. This is an example of that it heals you when you lock pads up all",ant
7118," Certainly run enough groups with stand EPS for those just kind of ignore the synergies and it's like this is extra damage waiting for you and they're like, oh cool so it can be really good on that range though. Right? And finally, they are actually very mobile. And this is probably one of the highest skill skill thresholds for the class the bolt Escape ability allows them to basically get close to empty space.",ant
7119," When it comes to Shields and self heals, the shields are a little bit more limited their in-class heels on the tank tree or pretty limited. However, because this is a warden and because they are actually functional as a heel class. It's entirely vital viable to run stuff like trees. Yeah, so it's like okay. I don't have a heat self-heal. It's really good. Except. Oh wait, I do Splat and it's cheap.",bee

And as the tank when the entire point is I want to control where people are that's a that's not a great thing. Now The Necromancer does have an aor have a ranged CC. It's not quite as large as the sorcs and as far as I can tell it does not have the self-healed built-in anywhere but",leech
7121," Um, and it's really good to like you can activate this you getting your getting a lot of resistance for a set period of time and this is something I think we skimmed over this we weren't really talking about alternates but it is something you see with the DK also where they've got a something called magma armor where they could soak a lot of damage for a short period of time but and this is a little bit like that but it's this is a really somatic sort of okay. Well you can take a ton of damage right now. I love it. I do actually really like the neck.",ant

They are expecting you to do the bare minimum of what you know tanking is and you know, if you're doing experimental builds, probably not the right place for that now something about that we sort of skimmed over here.",bee

So that's that's the ultimate hybrid their school PVP taught the other players with your Resto staff. Yes. It's on but they will know good point. Yeah. Yeah with that said about armor. One thing you probably will do is the five one one right? Like yes, five heavy one light one medium even",ant

I think it's still very useful like you just said to learn it and that's kind of the approach.

The damage Shield is going to be so low that people would probably still nuclear anyway, so it's balanced to that effect 1v1. Maybe not so much its survival in a big big group. You haven't got that whole while I'm still standing here. Haha. So I think they've made a fairly good balance across the board for it plus every minute.",bee

We've got this brings way of Martial knowledge back into the game because before it was your next attack or the next attack, which could be someone's like attack now, it's 10% additional damage for 4 seconds with a two second Gap. This was the second time. Remember Marshall knowledge being revised think the originally didn't have some like a Dodge Roll Effect or something. Yeah.",ant

It looks like they're making some of this stuff be very specific but still relevant rather than just being so specific and nobody ever touches it. Yeah, and I think this puts it at work. There's the only other side I can think of for Maelstrom normal drops at not a not a weapon that comes to mind is hunt leader has some use now at least 4 Stam Crow and then also for a-standin so that's another yeah.",ant

This used to be when you activate a class ability of 15% chance to surround yourself in a torrent deals shock damage the closest Enemy Within 12 meters every second for six seconds, and it's cool down as every six seconds what can't stack with itself. This has been changed so that the the proc chance is now 33 percent. The shock damage has been almost halved and there's a 15% chance that the damage you deal. This way will be restored to",ant

Oh, yeah it approximately",bee
7132," Okay, so that's the end of the light set. So this is these are all been light armor sets that have been changed up to this point. We've also got two medium armor sets have been changed. One of these is cinches bite. This used to be when you roll Dodge your weapon damage increase by 430 your weapon critical increased by 67. That's about half a percent. Right 6 5 7 it's not the house that work out. There was a bit less and less than 3/2 and I was actually that much. Okay, here's what I mean. Yeah.",ant
7133," Of course you do but this gives you that extra burst. If you are creating. It's a very cool way of doing it. It might be too strong with some setups, but we'll have to see it's always going to be really situational though because this is you're giving up a five piece bonus for this. So this is I think this is worth slotting for the five PS bonus now as opposed to before I was like this is worth the counting on the off-chance. Look at some random purple upgrade minutes imagine Maelstrom as well. Well, they have a mouse from Co-op several times already. I'm gonna shoot ya know how through the stamina.",ant
7134," Together at the same time now, which did not used to be the case. This is not swell previously. You've got two different sets in one makes you not die. And the other one makes you not die, but they both are different conditions. The first one it's only included when you die instead of turn into a statue you turn intercession for three seconds and you gain 200 ultimate which is nuts. You can't force yourself to die to get like a magma shell or something thrilling DK y una statue you immune to all negative effects, but you can still be healed so you can stand there and stone looking pretty and be healed.",ant

This is a nice setup. Yeah, and imagine you're in PvP and you are deliberately being tanky, but you need to be careful of your resources. You can be on quite a bit and then major protection kicks in at low Health alongside undef and you just sitting there laughs and thinking I'm going to heal when I feel like it rather than panicking because you're low plus you get major heroism everybody.",ant

But if you are deliberately trying to make sure you can mitigate as much as possible and you negatively affect their penetration values then yeah, you're really hard to take down and pariahs worth about like at low Health. It's worth about 10K for physical and sparse this so it's adding some shonky recovery. Like it's a chunky bitter resistance. Well, that's what major major fracture",ant

Yeah supers that I really like that application to it. You will get one of them. Was it for following mechanics and saving your party.

I click a thing and then everybody gets a buff. They've got some stuff like an ultimate where you can put it down everybody gets protection inside of it. I think it's minor protection, so they'll take less damage, but",bee
7265, So you lock them down and then you pull them in it's a little easier on that and it's a lot easier to manage when you've got enemies over in that general direction that you just need to stop them.

Both Escape shank and just keep doing this around the room and it does actually cut down and your travel time significantly. That's pretty cool actually. Yeah.

So there's a legitimate reason that it set up the way it is and if there's a legitimate utility in it, and I'm not going to knock it and say this is bad. I am going to say it's doesn't look as useful to me even with the upsides. That is that is very viable. I get what you're saying.",bee

But the ones you do use will be reduced so sustained is up and you've got all TJ region so you can use your ultimate more often and it's really cheap anyway, so that could work or on a warden. For example, we have a really cheap Barrel to miss stuff like that or even a template that could have some very very good applications, but they've got to fix that time.

That's true because they have they are the weapon reduction to cost as well.,ant

It's probably going to affect alts to but I don't think so 5% is not much and it's actually that's a tough thing though, isn't it? Because if you push it too far, you're going to attract Reyes. It's not going to be worth using if you have it too low. It's just hilariously powerful. You're going to raffle stop everything bring it back going hero. This is",ant

You can mix and mingle however you want now so that is actually a very light light stress Choice.

Whatever. I it's just fun and kind of goofy. So if you like swimming, there you go. Yeah, almost all the races have some weird little unique quirks. Yeah, that's the word for it. Yeah, and the swim speed is one of those it there's nothing really equivalent to it from anybody else a lot of them tend to be you know, because",ant

It's staying drunk. That's true. The nor directly are really neat race now so that I remember this the last time what I said was basically their job is to get slapped around punched in the face and not really notice that's changed a little bit now.

Like if you're playing a red guard you'll have a similar amount of smacks damn increase, but you will not have the health increase and that won't matter as much because you're probably not as",ant

So take some time as you're progressing and pay attention to what's happening around you especially with the enemies are doing and learn to try to avoid what they're doing to you and pay attention. Basically. I'm really this is this is something a 10 game. That's really skill-based. Yes. This game is very skill-based. It's not like a it's not a slow paced combat system. I like what you're saying.,ant
7352," Them almost all the ones especially ones you're going to care about. Yeah, you can already just by all the ones you care about including all the crafting think that's that's entirely doable right now, right? And so what I should we should probably elaborate on that for a second and what I want to say is a lot of people will be scared. They'll look at you know, I've got three class lines that have active abilities and they have passives. Then there are things like the Thieves Guild has passives the the Dark Brotherhood being a vampire or a werewolf.",ant

So you are in good hands in this community and in this game in general",bee
7354," To make yourself some money. So Stark you want to kind of give them like maybe even just a briefer of what this whole episode is. Yes, we're going to cover basically five different chunks of items that you can dig up as you're playing the game and this is these are very broad categories and how well they sell on the open market with some caveats for each. So we're gonna be covering gear which you get Gears you play and understanding you can sell some of this stuff to other players.",ant

7356," Semi frequently and if it's the trait you want if it's the way you want and it's the set you want and it's a price you're comfortable with that go ahead and grab it. It's fine, but I wouldn't recommend trying to sell that stuff because it is really a crapshoot especially because your profit margins on that are much much narrower than if you're working with drop sets. I'm glad you inform me about the world of being an on-demand or a short-order crafter cuz huh. I don't know. I guess I just didn't see that stuff.",ant
7357," So the biggest sets us on our path for motifs and recipes. These are fun. These are probably my primary thing. I move on the market just because I'm in situations. I get them a lot and they're pretty you know, they can be pretty worth the cost. You know, they're pretty worth worth selling I should say. Yeah, they're really Dependable with provisioning recipes. I took a bath on them like three years ago, simply because there were some changes.",ant
7358," Running into kind of what you're talking about without ever having been through that again anniversary to see you know it on a regular cycle. Yeah. Well, there's also the other side of this too. It's not all motifs.

7364, With that and this is I could be wrong about this. I think the drop rate on those is significantly higher than the drop rate on the Halloween hats could very well be so because Rarity by color is not just created equal across the right and something that was feedback with the original Halloween event. So three years ago now I guess was that those those hats were incredibly annoying to get it took a lot of time.,ant
7365," More stuff in the future here. Yeah. Should I got Shadow rn2, but whatever. Yeah shatter ends pretty snazzy. Maybe you'll come around some day bring it back. You've gotta be like that something and I still sort of wonder about this but they've got to have a plan to bring these things back at some point in the future simply because it's a lot of work a lot of time to put these in the game that shows in the price and the crown store and to say okay. This is just only gonna happen once and it's gone forever. I don't buy that.",ant

When you start out with a build that you won't actually learn how to play which could this could sound a little bit arrogant, but I think it's actually something you see with new players that are like, okay. I'm going to work from this build here. It doesn't it doesn't give you the breadth of experience of learning your class or learning how to play the game. I can be that anecdotal evidence to prove that at",leech

That's when people will craft themselves a separate set of gear, but really anything you pick up will be fine.

So you're getting some",bee

If you're on a PC can press the c key and it will show up under that character panel. It will actually show you how much time you have remaining on your horse training, but you want to make it maybe you're logging routine every day that maybe log your character out near the horse trainer and then start doing that.

It's like you'll have a new Zone that's added and in order to get to it. You'll have to clear everything else on your plate up to that point.

He didn't end up getting the money he was looking for and this could be like the Le'Veon Bell fuck you a tour and he could just be trying to take teams down because he's more he wants to prove to everybody. He didn't make a mistake and I think that that,ant
7764," Not even close. He could have a hundred receptions like it's true. So you ripped where to put them. You don't know where to put them yet. That's why I'm like we said earlier. This is such an early rankings list. I mean, what is it May May 20th, like we still got two months to go before trying to Camp. So I mean, this is just very early.

There are guys that that I trust and so it's not that I don't trust them that I want to take control as I see it's just if you are the first arriving officer you",bee
8292," After your Manpower, I love the way that that has transitioned over the past couple years. You're still involve. You're still getting dirty. You're not running the pools, but you're you're still very much involved. And like you said you're leading your team. Is that spun of command thing? Let's go. Yeah, I think that's the same.

All of those things are way easier to do when you've only got two or three of them do and not 10 because you're right again, you don't want to in the high stress situations as basic and for way to the train and as you can get but obviously you still want to be able to just do",bee

He's got that other perception, but now you've got somebody else who maybe is Doom a portion of what the deputy chief position would be even though that's not really",ant
8297," We've been doing that role or at least overseeing that position to the point where he knows what he's doing which is useful. And again, what we all should be able to do we should all be able to do those jobs on the nozzle on the ground crew teams. That's that's our jobs and you're right and the one of the biggest things that I've noticed over time is that exact change of allowing others to and people within your in your cruise to just you know, what I want that door breached go and do that go and do the thing, right? You know what you're supposed to do.",ant
8298," Yeah, yeah those tools as well while you're in the back then you're having those conversations. It's another piece of team building. It's another piece of trust as well because you're building that relationship with the two other people in the back as well as Takin orders and the leadership points from the front but you guys are making decisions, you know, feel more important in your role. You're not just the guy on the end of the nozzle doing the thing. That's an extremely important role, but you made the choice to or at least",ant

So I'm going to use an example of a dream that I have been manifesting into reality now to the point where it is in reality and the experiences quickly approaching the physical 3D experience is quickly approaching.

9317, And it again it we've talked before about the power of our meaning making our ability to interpret events in our life is having meaning for us. And that's really where our creative power is and there's there's a moment where we make that decision that no matter what anyone tells us. We're going to continue to stand rooted in that possibility continue to look for. How can this be possible regardless of what's coming back to us that?,ant
9318, Milland natural part of the process. I think it's so colorful normalizing this experience rather than getting freaked out. Oh my gosh that's coming up. Therefore.

9328," And really what it became president to is that when we Thrive it's not by accident. It's not by circumstance. It's not random when we truly Thrive. It's by choice. We're it's a choice that we make on some level now our consciousness of that choice may vary based on where we are in our path, but it is a choice and I also feel that it's not a choice we make once",ant
9329," How is it possible to create thriving life? We were talking about choice, right? We have to make this choice and be aware of it and contribute truth that to be our priority and that to me connect with a mindset.",ant
9330," Yeah, so what? Okay. So for what for one understand that even though it is all in your head. It is all a mental construct that doesn't necessarily mean that it doesn't feel very real. I don't want to minimize that oh, man. It certainly can feel like your physical safety is threatened and sometimes it takes that stepping outside of the situation looking at it objectively to say no. No, I actually am safe. Right? So again, I just don't want to minimize go the experience of it.",bee

9332," Yeah, for sure. So when we talk about creating a thriving life even in a title itself, we mentioned choice and design so we just discuss the choice and how it connects to mindset and what the blocks might be that we need to overcome to be able to to move from the survival state to the thriving State.

You're making I'm going to I'm going to stand up for myself, but you're really your choice is the place from which you standing up yourself comes. So on one hand, I could respond from a place of lack of scarcity of fear, and I could from a defensive place I could",ant
9335," Right. Yeah, and when we choose when we make choices from our mindset of I'm choosing to thrive the choices are different like we choose different things then when our focus is on just surviving and really it plays out in every every every sphere of Life. Mmm-hmm.",ant
9336," Inside if someone is not exactly the way we wanted that to be yes doesn't make sense. Yes, so it's really about what we accept because what we accept will continue, right what we agree to or agree for will continue in our life just like what we persist resist when we resist resist. All right. Yes, exactly. Yeah the same with what we accept continues.",ant
9337," Meaning to our life it it really does empower us to create the meaning that we want to experience. Hmm. Well sad, yeah, which also ties further into this idea of abundance. I think all of those concepts are very tightly interwoven. Hmm. Yeah, so when we talk about designing a thriving life we covered",ant
9338," And we're consciously choosing our orientation of the experience that that's that's standing in our power and saying I'm choosing to live my life. It's not happening to me. It's happening for me and I can I will own I will own my life. I will own my own experience of my life, even when it's chores.

9343," And it's like oh, wow, they have something that I've appeared not to have like you said, it's like focus on oh, wow, they're demonstrating to me that this is possible and then, you know if they're doing a demonstration and then it's like wow, I'm actually grateful for this invitation because I didn't even know I wanted that but they're showing up there. They're giving me a great example of how something like this is done how something like this is obtained or how I could potentially be like this and that's so much more empowering.",ant
9344," Exactly. I love that. Yes, so now because not really what we do not want we need to remember that becoming more clear on what we don't want is not going to get us what we do want to say that again. So one thing is Clarity, but other I think is what are we focusing our Clarity on? Yes, so us knowing",ant
9345, Right. Yes. So I think like it that the work here that the danger zone the pitfalls to avoid is keep shifting keep shifting from this evidence based in the past and this current situation plays to okay. I'm not denying this. Yes. It's staring at me right in the face. This is what it is right now.,ant
9346," So yes, I think that like that the clarity about what we want and really having the vision and the feeling is really important.

It's they did at the Texas in some way at the time, you know, if we're children. We adopt a belief that you know kind of protects Us in some way protects us emotionally physically whatever it is, but it perhaps the reason why this whole",ant
9350," I then started being aware of it and noticing every time I would say to myself or out loud. I don't know I would add yet and I'm figuring it out. Ha ha yes a reframe because I feel like a lot of time with people complain about is that they feel like they have to fake it till they make it right. So they say oh, what's the point of a few may I don't believe that well.",ant
9351," Right. Yeah, so that's the energy of formation any direction. Yes. Thanks the fire out of it. All right, so that's what we want to do here with this limiting beliefs so we can redirect and go to the next step. Yes. Okay. Alright, so we've become clear on what we do want we've had some of her limiting beliefs become made apparent and we've talked a little bit about how to share",ant
9352," As as you get this little of clarity. We're like, yeah, this is this is the feeling that I want then you start to wear it. You literally start to wear that feeling and you have to it's really this there's two sides to it. The feeling part is really the energy that gives life to the vision part.
