And we got a we got a bet the games a lot of I guess I wouldn't say great matchups. It doesn't feel I mean George LSU obviously is going to be a great game. But as far as other conferences goes it almost feels decided for everything everything almost kind of feels lucky. I don't know or in the big games you,bee
412," I mean, you know, it's in appstate. Yeah. Well, I'll say this AB state is good as they've been this year. You know, they've got wins over South Carolina on the resume. They've been ranked all year. You would think is sexy. They've been kind of in the National media they'd be laying more than a touchdown against anybody in this conference at home. Especially also Billy Napier apparently is going to be getting a lot of calls for some of these upcoming jobs that are opening up here specifically those three we mentioned last episode, Missouri, Arkansas.",ant
413, Look to them to dominate this whole game kind of similar to they did that second half in the first meeting. So I'm really not got scared of the -9. I'm kind of jacked. It's not it - 10 I want to agree with you here. I just have to pretty much go back on everything. I just said about playing a team twice and everything. I've had twice accept it when a number is this big the big number is not as a lot and I think that's a lot for a reason so I don't mean I don't,ant
414," This is Phil's the higher that thing gets the scarier become a spot just now looking at this total What's the total already nine and a half. It seems kind of high, you know, I mean you may be to score some points and they rely on their defense. They run the ball FAU. We know Lane puts up a lot of points but this year particularly, I feel like they've progressed a little in terms of points per game. Yeah. I got to be honest with you. I saw fa you play the first half of the first week of the Season against Ohio State where",ant
415," I'll probably tune in but I don't think I have a play for it. Yeah, then we got Georgia LSU LSU land 7 in Atlanta.",ant
416," Want to hear about it and I'm thinking if you are scared just by to 27 and a half. Yeah or something and roll it. I but I know one in this conference has been in 40 points of Clemson. That's true since their one point win over UNC. They have beaten everybody about 3540 every week. I've covered every week and I'll be riding them again and hopefully that'll end us having to hear like Dabo complain about I mean, they're going to be in after they win this year by a hundred like we",ant
417, playing injured and he is healthy right now last week. He was running around scoring touchdowns with his legs his arm. I don't think Brady and New England at this moment can keep up with them by the points. The Chiefs are going to score now and this is kind of happened when New England the last what two three four years always there's a point kind of mid to late season where they might drop one or two and National media acts like the sky is falling. I don't know if it is but I'll say this usually when they were looking when they look down the last couple years.,ant
418," This always happens so somehow someway, I always end up always end up having filled Rivers needing to complete a fourth-quarter drive to cover a game and it is over a million. It is so tough every Sunday just have Phil let you down. And so yeah, I'm not even thinking about touching this game. But if a juror on the Jags gardeners back in the saddle Garner's back in the saddle, he still got Leonard fournette eating running the ball catching the ball good receivers over there.",ant
419, give the Rams is Sunday. I think it's going to be the hot trendy little pick Rams McVeigh. They're going to make a label push for the wild card. No way. Russ is going to kick their ass. He just does it every time in prime time? I I think they win this game by 10 points. I love it both on the Seahawks their money log pick them. Whatever it is. Whatever it is that that is I think the most favorable on in college or NFL this weekend one other game on my little my sheet that I kind of saved for last because it's more of a lean at this moment.,ant

424," That's what I feel like the album really is. It's almost like a time capsule. Yes a time in your life that you're just kind of longingly looking back on and kind of wanted to go back to but yeah, you know, it makes perfect sense for them like kind of at the time it came out to because at that point they put out a couple records a bunch of like pretty Punky records, they'd been touring for a while. But like we're still playing house shows. They were kind of just like right on the brink of it and it's wild that they wrote This Record that was like about looking",ant

I mean, first of all, like you said this Drew you and I think good things is the first song that I heard that was on this album. I had heard some of their song from Chamberlain Waits before but like this is the first one that was made that made me kind of like I gotta I gotta sit down with this one rather than just like oh God",ant
426," You don't really realize it but it's kind of like when the there's an overture at the beginning of a play that kind of plays all the little bits of the different songs. And then you recognize them throughout its that version of that when you're not to make it literary it again, but like when you're writing a paper and in your intro, you're supposed to State your thesis. Yes, you know the points you're going to be visiting throughout this paper and then be like and by the end here's what I'm going to prove right and he actually writes a really good intro.

And then when you open them just like it it all explodes. Yeah, eloquent way of writing that my cabinet of canned sauce, right? I also think of it like a like a pantry sense where there's a bunch of shit that you're never going to touch but then like eventually you might have a need for it and it might be really shitty. It might.",ant
428," Okay, you grow up and like you're still a great imagine that the party gave me some of those vibes like I don't think I the storytelling on that album is very kind of romantic in a way where I'm like, oh, this is nice like it's nice. It's also reflective of like where I am now to like you get older you're just like, all right, things are not so bad luck. That's to this. Yes exactly, which is a cute character development that I like seeing from this album. Yeah.",bee
429," Stories of how we came to be in the same exact place exam time all the time and really that like, I know people who just got into the men's singers with rented world or after the party and I know people who kind of like me who have listened before this album and got it. I got into it maybe like a couple months after it came out just cause I didn't realize it and they had new music I was still on the old stuff. I love being able to kind of dissect this mutual thing that we all know about regardless of when we came across it. That's dopamine. It's the coolest way to appreciate something is to just",ant

But I love that if it does can recognize we can recognize it and we could kind of work through it in a way that clearly the men's hangers happen in some way since this record.

So, um, I saw them with the tribal",bee

Oh no, and then after that Captain were sinking in 2013 took it for a song called. Here's to forever. So holy fucking shit. That's a big change. It's a lot and it's like it's like a conspiracy theory, but it's actually true.",bee
437," Option that was there for him. So I don't know that's like a cute little tidbit that I like. It kind of dates the song a little bit and also makes it like makes Mexico such a reasonable place of escape to think about when you've clearly gone through a loss with this person because I don't know about you like I like I know I get kind of sentimental. I haven't really lost anybody particularly close to me, but if I'm going through something like I feel like being in an environment",ant

I'm able to find some athletic wear and I'm kind of okay with any brand at this point as long as the brand that moves just to kind of get that customer into my closet and looking at other things as well and the bids a great place to do that. So that is my goal. Yeah. Okay good. I will help you achieve that I'm excited. I actually have like a little pile of athletic wear that I need to list. So yeah I have,bee

I've already searched through and see people throwing things back or maybe I missed something and it was just hanging out on the top of the bin and it didn't look like anything until I flipped it and saw the tag so crazy the story never gets old. No, it'll never happen again. So let's say that you never know.",ant

I'm like, I'm not going to spend another second on this piece. Oh, no, I don't blame you at all on that. That's funny. We're both or I might have been like, oh, well, they are safety pin. Maybe I'll maybe I think I'll Stitch this and then it would go in a pile that I would never go back to I know myself now, then I'm not going back to that pile and I would just I would rather donate it and clear my head.",leech

So I left things too complicated. Yeah, count me out. Okay. Well, so we agree on that. Yeah, so that I left behind and I left the cool behind. Let's talk about a story Lori about our trip to the bins together. And yes, I know for Christmas.",ant

Yeah, she's amazing.

Look see how I stop myself from saying just Source in my closet because I know that won't happen. But but that's something I want to work on. So sourcing from your closet would be kind of the first strand which is free. If you have access to the Goodwill Outlets or the bins where you pay by the pound, that's a really inexpensive way to",ant

I feel like Free People is a pair of is a brand that gets missed in the denim Department sometimes because you know, they're Ted Cruz up and you sometimes don't always see it if they see that it's free people. Sometimes they'll mark it around the ten dollar Mark, but occasionally, I'll find free people denim for like four or five dollars and that's always a yes for me. But but you know in the higher range, I would pass on them, but I mean in general your average cost five six dollars at a thrift store.",bee
2395," One of the things you said earlier in the week you were talking about, you know, removing things from your closet that haven't sold in 60 days. I don't do that either I in fact, I just I had a rails dress that has been sitting for a while. I actually got it at an estate sale. I wonder if I should have added estate sales in there like as a 33.5 like before Retail Arbitrage because that is also it's like a little bit more expensive obviously than thrift stores, but not typically as expensive as Retail Arbitrage.",ant

If they thought it was a good price, you know, I was willing to take the chance on one and also knowing I have two sons who could also fit in this really high quality jacket and that honestly goes into a lot of my thought process. Sometimes I'll pick up something and say this is more than I want to spend. However, Angelina's 18 and I know she would love this so I could give this to Angie if it doesn't work for her or I try to buy things in my size.",ant

She's like, how do you even sleep at night telling people that you pick this up at the bins for a dollar and then you charge $55.",ant

I think there's something about that transparency with your viewers that people not that they expect but it's almost like a respect thing like, you know, and I think people see through that sometimes when you you can figure out if someone has spent $100 on that Madewell jacket, and now they've they're asking their viewers or they're asking their buyers on pause.",ant
2404, Completely a complete episode all on its own that we don't have enough time for today. But I think they like that that people need to keep that in mind that just because you're always buying things. It does it mean it's good. It doesn't mean it's bad. But if you're not moving inventory then why do you keep buying and why are you spending this money that you're trying to make to accomplish? Whatever goals it is or maybe two full-time income. That's my thought right? I think it's,ant

And if I list it for $75 and you like it, I don't send an offer.",ant

There are like junk shirts that I bought, you know, a year and a half ago better just sitting there and I just laugh at them when I look at them, but at the same time, I feel like I do have many many items priced over 50 60 dollars in my closet and I like to have items that are 15 dollars or less.",ant

But then like 7:30 comes around the kids go and I go downstairs and I find like the best time for me is to just take photos between like 7:30 and 9:30.

So I'll photograph I'll edit one.,bee

I feel like they have the information on their end, but they're just not ready or maybe not willing to share it they have to have the information but I mean to answer that question.

He dug himself quite deep and then when she was trying to say something right at the beginning he said can I cut you off and yeah. Yeah. She went no thank God. I was so mad when he said that and I think it was at that moment where everything clicked for Hannah everything that she's been worried about with Luke everything.

Yeah, so I have to say I don't think we can judge his amuse ictal totally based like I don't think he's bad at all. I actually think he's pretty good but I don't think we can base it off of no background music not in the setting for maybe the Acoustics in there. I don't know like that's not probably the setting he's used to playing music in. Yeah, and it's just him and his guitar on stage or not.",leech

Well, I thought was interesting throughout the entire group date is when another guy was doing something and they would cut off to Luke piece face.

I understand that this is a situation",ant

I actually think he's worse than can't or than Luke p is I think he's too because at least not yet Luke p is ridiculous, but he hasn't done anything. That's like creepy or obnoxious in the sense where I'm like a little concerned about him. He's only 24 so his at this could just be the most severe of maturity camps 30 is",ant
3922," Gasps of like Luke p and Cam and some of those other guys. Well, then there's people who fly so far below the radar that you don't even know they're there and I think that's kind of what she meant but the subtle energy is that she feels it even though he's not he's not putting on display, but he's not hiding it. It's just casually there in a way that she seems to like so I liked us and I think I'll stick around I think so too. Okay now we're into the hotel bar now.

I think we're giving like I mean, I like Harley Nevin and jigs Aiden Tanner. They're okay. They're all really great. But I feel like we're good. We're giving them all way too much time.

I think that she probably wants to explore this relationship while yes, it's filmed. Yeah.",ant
3950," Okay, so the upcoming Rose ceremony. I don't really know how this is going to work. How are they gonna handle it? Does Demi automatically always get to give the rose because she's the one that's part of Bachelor Nation do her versus Christian get a rose on a week. I don't understand how that's going to work.

It was one of those ones that was like it felt eventful when it was happening in a way, but also at the same time nothing really happened. Yeah episode of Seinfeld. Yeah. It was I was a little bored like I'm not gonna lie. I feel like for two hours worth it was not the drama just didn't hook in it.

Oh, yeah, so that is just an absurd amount of time to be awake. Even if you're in bed watching Netflix. It's an absurd about a time to be awake. So then you think about on top of that.",ant

4025, Because they're bad. I don't know if this was ever seen in your life. The plot was super bad all the songs. So if you like when you're in kindergarten and you're writing on a piece of paper and you start to run out of space because you're writing your letter so big and then like you start to make the letters small so they can fit and then you start writing down the side of the paper because you're like I don't I have no room for this cat is like that's what every song in cats is like because they try to fit so much mumbo-jumbo until one bar. It's really bad.,ant

Hmm, for those of you that are new and don't know how this work. You know that Peter hands out roses that lets people stick around first impression Rose. Just your regular rows.

So a lot of nerves he handled it very well for someone who apparently is also never been on a roller coaster kind of weird, but as not a thrill-seeker know and like you mentioned before I think they always do some sort of bungee jumping skydiving type date, I think obviously the thought behind that is something that's a little bit scary and you can really vulnerable for it's something that brings people closer together. Yeah in many ways, so I guess you",bee

But Tyler see really came through a lot last night. He brought her flowers and I kind of love this because he kind of went over and I said I wanted to bring her flowers. Yeah didn't try to make out in front of the other guys or anything just Henry's flowers and you can see Mike in the background just smiling like he couldn't help but also be happy for his pal, which I thought was really cool because obviously they're all fighting for the same.",bee
4030," Choices, it's just not cool and it is not someone that I think that anyone wants to have in. Yeah a partner. And when I another just great moment for Tyler see is when Luke was talking about the situation to the guys and Tyler's like I respect her for doing this. She's living it up. She's right. What you do in Riga, right and Tyler, you know Tyler wants to end up with Hannah just as much as everyone else, but he understands that she needs to work through this process in her own way and",bee

I thought you were coming back to me. She basically was quoted explaining that Jed told her look. This is just for my music. I just need a platform. I don't even care about her. I love you. That's all it is. And then he left for the show. And then she did not hear from him again for a significant amount of time. So, I guess she started getting kind of",ant

4033," Eat something that she doesn't see right. So maybe that's where the disconnect is. I don't know it's hard to tell it is hard to find I would be curious hearing which I'm sure we'll hear a lot about when the season ends as Hannah's watching this back live if she stands behind keeping him for so long if she would do it all over again. Would you do it the same way or now that she's seen the show if she's like, wow, if I would have only seen this or that or the other thing I would think she would have to change her mind. I would think somebody really interested to hear her thoughts on that. Yeah, but Luke comes out and",ant

I love that and I think I mean, I mean Evan have talked about this several times as well.

I could choose to take that and read all the negative comments. Like I just read someone yesterday said oh my match campaign. Someone say it looks like it's breast things right and I'll take it as you're right. You're right. It probably was thinking that maybe that's a platform that I have to respond in a positive or negative way and someone else may take that and say you know what Mike has all this.,ant

Yeah. So both those breakups happen within like a day or two of each other Yeah couple weeks ago now seems like it was all cordial though.

There's a lot of problems with that. Do you believe that that's really what he thought I don't you think that's what a gestation period is you're probably right. That's probably where that came from.

Is it just because Hannah really likes chicken nuggets. There is an abundance of chicken nuggets around and Noah.,ant
4052," Ants and he was being fair. He understands that there are other people there. Yeah, the are trying to form relationships but besides just him and he respects that and I think there's a lot of people came and licked P who do not understand or respect that and there's no way you can survive in that atmosphere. If you do not understand that that is what's happening. Yeah, so when cam got his time he prefaced I want you know that I'm a deep person myself and like that's you have to say that if you just say that you're a deep person over and over again the chances are you're probably not. Yeah, I would agree.",ant

Yeah, you know, that's a bummer but she didn't feel well I feel good about it. I trust her that's it. And I think you handled that really? Well. Yeah, and so that was nice to see that he was rewarded after handling it so well not coming back and you know moping around about not getting the one-on-one date Rose. I think that he I think he deserved to get the rose because I think he handled.",bee
4054," And yet out the season. Yeah, this is a thing I think because that instance kind of flopped a little bit Yeah. I think she almost has to come back. We want dummy give us more. Dami. Dami. Damn. We're huge dummy fans over here until want her on the TV every week doing something cool and catching people doing bad stuff. Yeah. I love it just it's like CSI Demi. It's incredible. She deserves her own TV show if we're being honest. So one thing that did kind of happen.",ant
4055," More forward with her. I think that's what you kind of wanted from him. So gonna see more Peter the pilot coming up. He was he's great. I think that Hannah obviously there was no one else that could have gotten that group date Rose is a hundred percent. Happy Peter. Obviously, it wasn't gonna glue guy came in think of who else stood out as I'm saying. I don't think anyone saw even in the photo shoot itself. She couldn't stop talking about Peter they kiss during the photo shoot and she kept saying how she loved being around him and she loved kissing him and she loved being near him and he made her feel good and she just",bee
4056, At that took so cam shocker went home. Yeah shocker. I think that there was no way she could have kept both Luke p and cam without just an outrage from yeah everyone. There's no way they were both so aggressive and ridiculous and last night's episode that you could not possibly have kept them both. She and I was nervous. I really thought that she was going to give that last Rose to cam II didn't think it was possible. I if she did that I think a lot of people including the guys I would lose respect for her.,ant
4057," Talking before that. I am kind of a seasoned veteran of Bachelor. I'm watching I've watched many seasons followed many of the storylines and what happened with all of these contestants 7 is much newer to the experience. He just started in Colton season. So we'd love to hear a little bit from you about how you kind of got started and all of this madness. Yeah. Well first off welcome Evan, I hope you're having a good time and Bachelor Nation. It is a blast but ya know",bee
4058, I really like it. I mean I know that and I've been kind of like a mixed Choice across the board. But also I think it I stand by that with well first I'm actually curious like what y'all think Hannah like we're you excited when you first heard about Hanover you kind of like what had a like. Where did you fall? I was thrilled. So like throughout Colton season. I was like this girl is different. She's kind of kooky and like for someone who's never seen,bee
4059," It happened, but for the most part is like yeah, just rotating different people and and it's it's that basically what like that your bachelorette is. So we're just like here for we're here for the journey, you know as a as they say, yeah. I see I see a lot of parallels between like though the world of bachelor in the surrounding social media and the NBA and the surrounding like MBA Twitter. Those are two areas of social media that I live in and Thrive off of all the content so many memes.",ant
4060," Happened. Yeah, I mean that's just like a very dainty Journey. That's this is all taking because like when I was watching in 2016 and this is never the goal to be all of a sudden like just fully emotionally invested like it's probably one of my biggest Hobbies at this point and I say that just with a very kind of sad tone, but it's we're gonna it's okay. You should definitely work. We're doing a project s so, we we get it. We're all here together the camaraderie house now.",bee

That's awesome. I get that though because I think it you know cattle Evan and I are just casual Pals and I think watching the show together now doing the podcast now, we're now we're Bachelor Nation friends for life. Yep. So it looks like we have about six minutes before this phone thing kicks us off before we let you go.",bee

I'm Evan Delaney and welcome. We're excited to be here. Only one week left not even a full week. Only one episode left. Yeah to find out the fates of all of our Pals is there to our finale? Are they going to take four hours on a Tuesday? I honestly I'm in I mean, it could be seven hours and we're still going to watch so I don't know. I think it's only",bee
4063," Yeah, the whole time even when Blake was like you're the one low blah blah. He was so invested in her and she never reciprocated it back in the same even like Stratosphere of emotion, right and in Christina's defense. She was like quote-unquote the one for Blake after he had like three or four other ones before Christina is all the other cars were taken off a lot. Yeah, and also I found out that the only film for three weeks. Amen. Well this whole thing goes down in three weeks. Yeah.",bee
4064," Thing about this. Yes is reading into this. Okay, is that Chris Harrison said like anybody else want to accept a rose? No one no one. Okay, which is super awkward and everyone kind of felt so bad for him Luke posted on his own Instagram that didn't have that that is not what happened. And that Chris said, well not only ship time to go home say goodbyes. Yeah, and then he posted a clip of said thing like they're saying that the voice. Oh like Chris Harrison said that as a voiceover in the edited in. Yeah, so if you look at the clip you see Chris Harrison saying,",leech
4065," She's very invested good friend. So she sent me this thing earlier. So Luke tweeted whatever I'll drop this, but I just wanna say I'm disappointed Chase responded and said hey, but I understand you're embarrassed by it. But I recall there was a lot that they a good bit that they did cut out that you should probably be grateful for so maybe relax on calling out the edits and it will blow over much quicker for you dang. So maybe more to come not sure what that really means. Yeah Blake but are not Blake. Sorry Luke kind of strikes me as like a sourpuss type of person anyway,",bee
4066," All together. Yeah, we'll see so good for them. So that was it. It was kind of weird that she was walking through the hotel with like no shoes on and like a bathing suit to like surprise him at the door. Yeah, super weird strange but whatever. But yeah, so hopefully they got to go on a date or something. Yeah, I don't know but that's that who did get to go on a date was Hannah and Dylan they went to the little kid's birthday party which is kind of random weird. It was super super weird. Like how do they producers find these people? Like, hey can people come to your birthday party? Yeah super weird, but it was kind of nice.",bee
4067, She got a lot of yeah time to really show her personality. I freaking love her. I love that. She's honest about her feelings. She cries when she needs to cry. She just seems like such a great friend like I love Katie. So katieandchris kind of have a lot of back and forth where they,bee
4068," I don't think I can get there. Yeah, and kind of ends it and they're both sad and he's like, okay and he tells her like they both leave whatever sobbing. Oh my God, she chases him down the beach and she said, I'm sorry John. I don't want you to go and he's like by taoiseach whatever so they both leave she is beside herself. I think immediately upon breaking up with him. She thought oh wait, I think I made the wrong choice. Yeah, but it looks like in the previews. Those are always a lie. Always like I don't believe for one.",ant
4069," Okay, and there's even a creation tool that will allow you to record and edit your podcast. No way from your phone or from your computer. Ok, but will they distribute it for me? Because I don't really feel like doing that stuff either they sure will and guess what what they can do that on Spotify on a podcast on Stitcher on so many I can't even evening. I bet I can't make any money off of it though. Can I that's where you're wrong you can make money with no minimum listenership. What?",ant
4070, So I was completely ignorant to who this guy was probably about two weeks ago. Yes. I am to most of these people. Yes Universe. This is true Reality Steve is very polarizing figure in Bachelor Nation. But in one way or another pretty much everyone I'd say knows who he is either because they love is spoilers and they can't wait for them to come out or because they try to avoid his spoilers at all cost or maybe a little mix of both which is kind of where I fall on the Spectrum. I think I've been in the camp of trying,leech
4071," To church. Oh, yeah. Yeah, like walked into this beautiful church that he just like open the doors. He walked and he's only owned in there. He kneels down to pray I assume and then left like that was that was a very dramatic scene just to try to Circle back to his opening that he had found his religion and faith and everything, which it was just kind of I don't know. It was kind of weird. It's all kind of out of place and he was in the middle of being a complete douchebag and it was like oh, but I",bee
4072," More action. This is taking too much times thought that ABC should have just put on Grand Hotel an hour earlier. I called it a day just really thought you were in talk about km when you were like, yeah ABC I dunno it just my mind went right there. So sorry. I know a couple of things from the the sit down first. I thought I'd some point Luke P was going to walk in and go. Can I steal you for a second? Right that question would have been hilarious. It would have been really funny especially since the season is over like that was unfunny. Yeah. Also, she said Luke P was the best kisser.",leech
4073," That's right. I'm probably gonna end up watching it. Oh, yeah a hundred percent. I'm going to watch it every you don't know how many times I've said. I think a lot of people have been like I'm never watching the show again and here I am four more. So one other interesting thing about a preview that we saw which I'm interested to see what you thought of it was that someone has a ring and they are going to propose and I 100% think that she sends Luke home after the whole sex shaming situation and then I think because he literally can't listen or respect other people's decisions. I think he's going to come back.",bee
4074, And put all my articles up there and people can just read it. So I don't have to worry about sending out a mass email every Tuesday morning or whenever the show was airing back then I think was Wednesday's back then. So how did you go from doing Recaps to becoming this source for spoilers? I that that evolution is really interesting to me.,ant
4075," That's so interesting it to me. That's like a basketball writer. Who hates basketball. Yeah. I mean, it's it's I mean, I don't I don't hate anything. I just have way more shows that I would rather watch than this one. Like I just think it's and I think you can tell that my writing over the years. I mean, even when I started writing it about the show a 2003 when I spoilers weren't even a thing for me back then it was just me making fun of the show because it's so easy to make fun of it's so contrived and so manipulated it's so",bee
4076," Sued, so if they've kind of It kind of kept out of my hair for the most part, but I was sued back in 2011 and it was it was my fault. I had reached out to contestants after they had gotten home from filming and offered money and they you know turned over my exchange with them to production. And so they had are they had a thing to go after me for and then but we settled nothing. Nothing came of it. We had a settlement agreement.",bee
4077, Of Thrones was one of those. Did you ever get any spoilers on that?,ant
4078," All right. Well that was super interesting. We got a lot of very honest information and really unique angles really fascinating how he works and how he doesn't really like the show. Yeah. I thought that was super interesting that he doesn't watch the show, but he obviously has an appreciation for the show because it's basically made a lot of his career he player in The Bachelor Nation whether what do you guys like it or not? Right. Yes, right. He's hard to avoid. Even if you don't want to see spoilers, you're gonna see him until just now I've done a pretty good job of it.",ant
4079," I'm really excited about Blake. I think Billy. I think Blake's gonna probably be like a star of paradise suicide got his heart broken. Yes. He was Becca's runner-up. He was just all in for her. So I think that I think Blake's going to be kind of a kind of a king of paradise. I think he's gonna get a lot of attention. He's a good guy good looking guy. So I think he'll do very well in paradise. Yep. We have from Colton season last year Kalin. Yeah Hannah B's kind of Nemesis feels too strong, but they butted heads quite a bit. So that'll be I'll be",ant
4080," Doesn't get much better than that. I would have rioted the street at jpj did not get on this. I mean it would have been it would been a weird.

I'm good. Like I feel connected to God and then and then like retrospect or like on the other side if I had or if I had been like more sexual lately.

So who was that person for you? My granddaddy he was he was a missionary with the Southern Baptist Church for 40 years. And then in his older age, he taught himself to read Hebrew.

So, how do we move forward like what is a mess?",bee
6413," Want to get these shots that are more abstract and that make the body like art. Yeah, and that was kind of the impetus. And then from there I started painting bodies like figurative paintings and just trying to search for beauty and bodies that are not represented in the media because the media kind of shows us this like certain type of woman that I didn't really identify with and so just trying to find beauty in their bodies and then eventually that kind of parlayed into finding Beauty in my own body and small.",ant

It was a very loose idea of God and I had a spirituality as a child and it wasn't it wasn't religious but",ant
6417, I mean just the idea that that this kind of deconstruction transcends Christianity is I think a topic all on its own that it's just it's not Christianity isn't the thing that you have to like default like dissociate from to be able to start finding yourself and start believing in your body and start like finding wholeness. You can find that coming from any sort of space non-theistic or any other kind of space to but it's interesting that once once you do start finding that wholeness and you start finding that space where you,ant
6418, in the some friends about whenever your home life is very traumatic or like my father for example suffer from alcoholism and finding Christ really saved him from that. So whenever you have something that's fundamentally very unlike unlike guess secure insecure at the foundation the finding legalism or fundamentalism feel so safe and so fundamentalism.,bee
6419," Yeah, I relate to that and I love that you say like you fundamentalism it healed him and saved him and that it's like you having space for people and and where what what is working for them and not trying to I think this I think growing up in Christianity. There's this like mentality of like you have to go and save everybody and everything and it's like",bee

No one's responsible for mine. And like I'm probably sincerely wrong about something right now as I happened in the past and thank goodness that people are patient with me. Yeah. Yeah. I love that and I you know something that I love about just the way you communicate is that is like, you know, basically not",ant

What is the weight of religion and and the Savior mentality and all of that kind of stuff so I would just love to know like like who who were you,ant
6422," Yeah, but also I've been able to find it in my body and other places like over food and cultivating in spaces that aren't inherently religious at all have a couple of friends who are not religious that I do brunch with and go to concerts with and they don't have a foundational spirituality even like I do today and I find God and so many of those moments in ways. I never found God in the church.",ant
6423," Yes, Winter Jam. Yeah, woah, yeah flashback. Yeah, so the whole thing it's very like it's very incredibly triggering and painful all the while. I'm deconstructing but all the while and feeling family issues like family things spiritual stuff and career things on my mind is just blown all the time. Yeah. I've lots that I'm like kind of Shifting through but I only say all of that because I definitely relate you with the whole world.",ant

I was like no like look away like look away from everything that was healing a good and that's just not that's not true. That's not healthy. That's not whole that's picking this being yourself apart.

I don't want to change anything about you, but I think anyway, so he's just like that's his whole thing.

6427," Beneath that the very center I believe is divine and that this is actually a big breaking point for me. And whenever I was like, I don't think I believe that you have to be saved to get the holy spirit is whenever I was talking to people from all around the world as a coach and I started realizing that everyone had this like guiding something this voice of in the wake of wisdom this Source this God self and I was like, this is interesting. I'm talking to people who are witches and I'm talking to people who are atheists. I'm talking to people.",ant

6607, When the ball end is the frontcourt onslaught side engage on the play all the way to the basket do not assume that the lead official is going to be able to get over in refereed at play. So when the ball comes into the frontcourt onslaught side referee that play all the way to the basket.,ant
6608, If the lead for some reason is referring to low post area because he has a matchup that he doesn't want to leave.,ant

6626, Was it interference by the defensive team? Was it a good block?,ant
6627, I think it was a good block.,ant
6628, This is a very difficult call for the lead official because the ball is above up around the room level. He has to get his eyes up there. He now gets obstructed by the backboard.,ant
6629, And as you can recall.,ant
6630, Your man mindset should be move up come up towards the top of the key. So now you are putting your position yourself in a position where you can see through to play and referee the defender. So when you're in that slot position on drives to the basket don't move down.,bee

I don't know why I feel like more connected to the season to cast and it's probably because it's longer it's a longer season in every cast member was really involved in the season. I feel I feel like they did a really good job of like season one, you know Christine and Morgan were kind of pushed to the side except for Christina's Broadway audition. Whereas here it's like everybody has their moments. Everybody has camera time and I just feel like they're more personable and maybe they just knew how to act, you know, after watching season one there like we're going to do this better.",ant
